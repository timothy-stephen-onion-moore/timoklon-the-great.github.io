_HINDI IS A BEAUTIFUL ALPHABET_

_IF YOU CAN WRITE IT_

_IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT MY CALLIGRAPHY SKILLS ARE NOT WHAT I THINK THEY ARE_

_WHAT IS WRITTEN MAY WELL BE COMPLETELY INDECIPHERABLE EVEN IF YOU COULD READ HINDI_

_I DON’T KNOW_

_THE RHYMES… THEY WERE PERSONAL… I WAS TRYING TO JUSTIFY…_

_LOOK, THIS IS MEANT TO BE THE SUN; RIGHT?_

_EVERYTHING COMES OUT OF ME; SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I CANT CONTROL IT_

_THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL BOOK_

_I AM A BEAUTIFUL HUMAN BEING_

_ACCEPT THE PAST; SOAK IN LIGHT AND TRAVEL ON… A STAR HAS NO DARKSIDE_
