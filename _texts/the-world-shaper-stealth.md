title: The world shaper - stealth
---

Stealth. Not a God, but unlike any other being in that he was never created, but exists. His existence is entwined to the existence of reality and the universes—like the Gods—but in a much more physical way. His being has the natural ability to bend reality; to change anything as he sees fit. His capabilities are endless, he remains an amused pbserver until he decides to visit the Fay realm of Timoklon in their third age, destroy the Blood Mage and take over the planet. He lets it get destroyed a few thousand years later, then conbimes the Terlys [?] and the Orvak [?] realms, creating Orvaklys, a world teeming with war for millennia, until Stealth combines it with our Earth, any minute... now.

Stealth also:

- Killed Rag-Tun, the greatest Minotaur Lord who ever lived.
- Visited a pub in Brighton in the early 1960s and drank a pint in the form of an old black man wearing tweed.
- Killed Hitler.
- Created Hitler—or at least, made him do what we all know he did.
- Is Darren Brown.
- Had sex with Mary while she was asleep, while Joseph was in the bed. This, on Stealth's part, was completely unnecessary. He had no idea the baby would become Jesus Christ. The three kings were just following the light of his spaceship he'd placed in orbit while he banged the virgin mother.
- Had an affair with Hilary Clinton.
- Denies having had an affair with Hilary Clinton.
- Broke the moon from the Earth.
- Created scientologists.
- Planted all those dinosaur bones so we wouldnǯt become creationists.
- Taught Srilnca.
- Is a fan of Tim Kringǯs 'Heroes'.
- Mastered the art of tapestry, then rubbed it in Ranoul [?] Cool's face. The art itself, that is—not his mastery of it. This, inevitably, made Mr. Cool the master-—but when designing tapestry, he could only ever use his face.
