title: Are you a winner or a loser?
---

<br>

‘If you’re going to split the world into winners and losers, then yes, I suppose you can call me a loser. And that’s because I pay homage to one universal law: that you cannot win them all. And winners concentrate on what they know they can win so they grow accustomed to success and lose pleasure for it; like an addict they must aim constantly higher—and when they lose it is a crushing defeat.

I think the world would be a much nicer place if we were all accustomed to losing, so we could take it more in our stride, and treasure more what we can win.’

‘So you’re a loser?’

‘Yes.’

‘Yeah, me too. But they’re both defence mechanisms. I think, as a species, we just don’t like losing. It’s not in our nature.’

‘But that doesn’t make sense. We have the ability to change our perspective; the whole win/lose scenario becomes irrelevant.’

‘Who’s to say that ‘perspective’ is yours?’

‘What?’

‘You say we have the ability to change our perspectives—but when it comes to matters of the heart… We can’t quell the way we feel. And a loss is always felt.’

‘Well that’s what I was saying, but that we should all… not be so hidden about it; trying to mirror our own self-perspectives, you know, just… take what we can, I suppose.’

‘Yeah, that’s life, son. You keep your dick up.’

‘…I can’t.’

‘See, you are a winner. Ah, don’t worry about it son. We’ll get there.’
