[Chorus]

- We—co-create—our own fate
- {:.indent-1}—Everything’s connected
- God—God in man—man from ape
- {:.indent-1}—Everything’s connected
- We—co-create—our own fate
- {:.indent-1}—Everything’s connected
- Man–man from stars– man from ape
- {:.indent-1}—Everything’s connected

- My behaviour’s chemical, nurture biological
- Determined by the stars in space.
- Don’t rely on suicide, meet you on the otherside
- It’s not even your life to take.
- See things from the stratosphere, we’re so unimportant here
- What’s the point in asking why?
- Struggle of the underdog, too much love or not enough
- We die to live and live to die.
- Meanwhile in the stratosphere, Huston we’ve a problem here
- Someone’s cut a hole in the sky.
- Planet in a petri dish, interference hit and miss
- Soon there won’t be rivers to cry.
- God’s pitch-shift out of time,
- Created an ape infected with the spark of divine.
- Mix X with the Y chromosome,
- One to destroy the other tries to find a home.

[Chorus repeat]
