- I wonder what it's like
- for all the fishes in the sea
- squirt squirt squirt
- no touching, really
- everyone's basically the same
- their life is more three-dimensional
- than ours will ever be
- because we're not like that, really
- are we
- pregnancy's a real burden
- women need helping and protecting
- but not often enough, really
- to foster inequality
- more like yin and yang
- just two different sides
- both playing their roles
- but then we stumbled into agriculture
- and man sought to subjugate the world
- as is our place, to be fair
- our god-given dominance
- and superior intelligence
- be fruitful, multiply
- churn them out
- and you'll live out all your days
- under our fierce, unwavering
- protection
- protection, as was seen
- accepted, unquestioned
- because of the physical facts of life
- nothing gets in
- but neither does anything get out
- and don't you dare cross us
- because we're doing it for your own good
- and now
- a thousand lifetimes later
- we find ourselves not churning
- still with the same old struggles
- deconstructing and eroticising
- living, and dying
- but we don't need to play the roles
- the world subjugates us into playing
- so long as we're born blank slates
- and it isn't genetics
- makes all of you so much smarter
- so much stronger
- than us
- we live in hope, or don't
- and that's the difference
- isn't it
- between the right and the left
- take nature as inescapable
- and make the best of what we've got
- or pledge yourself to a future
- beyond the span of your own life
- one more equal
- one more fair
- and let's face it
- one more sexy, too
