MEANWHILE… ON ANOTHER SPHERE…

‘Did somebody say heaven? You know I’m through with that cultural, ceremonious, religious bull-doggy; what are we in the dark ages again now? You know there ain’t no big bearded man in the sky, and there ain’t no souls to us neither. What we got is this night here, and nothin’ here is sacred; everything burns; everything crumbles. You know this.’

‘What do we know?’

‘I’m saying—we know what we can hold on to. My fists; my dick, you heard? My fuckin’ balls. And our words. That’s what we’ve got that’s real.’

‘I appreciate your ferocity, friend. Really, it’s one of the reasons I like you so much. And you’re right—everything burns, everything crumbles… And that’s why I don’t need no priest to tell me that the fire, and the dust, is sacred. Your balls too. Everything is sacred. Understand that if you say you believe that God created the universe, or if you say you believe the universe came about by chance, you pull apart what these words mean and all you’re saying either way is ‘I believe that I don’t have a fucking clue how the universe came about’. We don’t even know how, let alone the why. But you’re right again that this here is what we have. It’s about heaven on hearth, brother; here. Co-existence, and creativity. Open that fierce mind of yours because I believe that human potential is limitless.’
