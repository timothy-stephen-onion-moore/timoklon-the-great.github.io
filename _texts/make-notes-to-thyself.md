title: Make notes to thyself
---

<br>

- Make notes to know thyself.
- Thine feet, note the footnotes
- In the crags you stumble
- Across; while my head is
- Spinning; revolving.
- Through pretentious pages;
- Under hills and over valleys;
- You have still forgotten.
- And remain; still as the
- Rock spins.
- Timoklon, Mecusieth;
- any  of the names you give:
- What happened in-between
- The leaves in the mountain
- passes? Where is the
- Begotten love that shaped
- You; where is that over-
- Powering lust for redemption?
- Where is the life
- And why is it not here?
- Remember your own face;
- Embrace this body
