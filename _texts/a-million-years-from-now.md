<br>
A million years from now some genius will discover a genetic marker for duplicity in living things. And, for want of a better word, they will call it intellect.

Mankind shall exist in a global and possibly multi-planetary state of collective anarchy; like the super-man we will take our energy directly from the sun and have no need for waste, and hypothetically this would seem to outrage any reason for harm: each other and ourselves.

But changes—history—a million years from now backwards in time some genius realized that our conception of ‘reason’ shall always render redundancy (?). And, unless we evolve into immortals; love shall always seem to give us reason.

It’s the perception. Our powers of observation; where the monkey sees a tree and we see beauty—makes room in concept for ugly.

Conquest.

Six point three billion, approx.

Not necessarily what is nice or enjoyable; but what is good—right—TRUE. As opposed to that which is bad, wrong, or false. If we could love without that perception—then, perhaps, there would be no difference. Every member of the animal kingdom bar only homo sapiens is enlightened beyond the dreams of any Buddha. Only—they were born that way. And we were born another.

You cannot learn to love everything. We have to eat, and shit. And dream. And sky. And even in a world without law in which no living thing were ever angry, or hungry, or frightened… we would still use each other. Through minor facial twitches, if nothing else. Every exerted expression some plea to our almighty consciousness—‘Am I not proven; father? Mother? Sister, brother?’ Have we not become; finally?

Ever?

And despite the lack of proof—the lack of reason beyond subjectivity—annihilation still seems to me the only logical response—the only humane course of action. But if a voice were left to breathe the question, I would have no answer.

Still now we have no answer.

Is it conceivable—validfi and verifi—for ourselves? This freedom?

Why?

No.

Follow this—and you are damned. Eat this book—and there never was a problem.

Goat.
