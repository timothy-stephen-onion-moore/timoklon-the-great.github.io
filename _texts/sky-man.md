'When last did you just take a minute to look at the sky?' <br>

'Every minute of every waking day.' <br>

'Oh, don't worry about him – that's the sky man. He just sits there all day, looking at the sky.' <br>

'I still got my eye on you, Krutowski.' <br>

'You know when you sit at this window sometimes, you tune into all kinds of bass frequencies from miles around.' <br>

'Well I can͛t hear any. Can you?' <br>

'It's not working now... I think it's because you're here.' <br>

'Then the clouds spoke to them both:-' <br>

'You can be heroes!' <br>

But then the clouds were back, and the time immemorial seemed like a constant force and presence around us... slowly seeping away and each of us falling into shadow. <br>

'Heaven only knows what dreams can come of such unadulterated treachery?' <br>

'Treachery?' <br>

'I've dusted you time and time again old sailor, know this is how the wind will blow.' <br>

'You can't leave us in here, man.' <br>

'You wanna bet?' <br>

'So, I told a stiff joke then had a quick drink and parlayed down to the venue.' <br>

'Only – on the way I had this vision – like a microcosm in space and time and I was there forever just for this one second, and when I was released it was like I'd lived a million lives and I'd been given another chance with my first, and I felt this ecstasy right from my toes into my eyelids that was bursting and relentless and insufferable like a great heat; a hotness so violent and indiscreet that only something like a long-day-long-cold drink can cover.' <br>

'Since then I haven't really thought about workin' much,' <br>

And then the ground shook and the clouds parted once more, and the veneration was beheld in all four corners of the earth. <br>

'Your reverence?'<br>

'...hmm?'<br>

'Billy left another toad in one of the boy's toilets this morning, I've notified his parents and held him back this afternoon, is that to your agreement?'<br>

'Hmm? Yes, oh, yes, certainly; boy needs a good walloping if you ask me.'<br>
