<br>

It was said, once, that there was a land surrounded by mountains that berthed two twin rivers, and that the people who inhabited the land had become like bulls, hoofs and horns, and that they were a blood thirsty, nomadic people. It was said that men had travelled there in their thousands seeking to find out more about these people, but that none had ever returned.

It is only due to recent events that their story can now be told, and the story of the Minotaurs begins in a very different part of the world.

In the far south, deep in the jungles of Xuāqu’rlo, there had once been a vast empire of bull-headed men who worshipped and served the Emporer ‘Bull-God’ Urā-Khān, who used men as slaves and slaughtered them for sport, building temples from human skulls. It now lies in ruins, and the people of the land say it was the jungle itself that ensnared them.

But we have heard a different story. The prophet Jolensalin, who has come back to us after travelling through the region, has told us that even deeper into the jungle there is another race of men, who have become like lizards who inhabit the far depths of the jungle before the coast. He says that the two horribly mutated races fought constantly, and that eventually the reptilians must have fought off the Minotaurs, or, at least, their civilisation. He says that those we see in the north in that well defended land are the survivors, who not so much fled as retreated, to build and train an army capable of burning down the entire forest and slaying every lizard.

This is how we imagine it would have first started.

And now a kind word from Rag-Tun:-

> ‘You have it all wrong, you fools! And now you will all kneel before your God the Mintoaur King Rag-Tun, and you will shed your blood for him, and you will give your life for him! ARRGH!’
…This will all make sense, in time…
…I’m sorry; we’re out of time…
…Got any Kahlua?...
