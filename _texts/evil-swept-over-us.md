title: Evil swept over us like a thick cloak of fur

<br>

‘Evil swept over us like a thick cloak of fur, spreading like fire between homes, brothers, our own people…’

‘Do you know what Einstein said about Gandhi?’

‘…There was nothing we could have done. It was like… a sickness that was already in us. When the evil came we fell or knelt… I kissed the ring of my betrayer, and now we are slaves to it.’

‘He said that future generations will not believe that a man such as Mahatma Gandhi walked amongst the living—and I think I know what he meant. There are people today who deny the existence of Jesus Christ, and why? Because he could do things that we do today; like the revival of the recently deceased and the chemical manipulation of liquids? I mean… when a man can emancipate an entire nation without any violence—that’s a miracle.’

‘Every day out people witnessed miracles, with every passing year we amassed more and more knowledge. But it was our ignorance that conquered, ignorance and our lack of faith… For what darkness holds… It was in us and it was all around us, from the very beginning. We were blind.’
