'See, what I ask of you is impossible.

To put your mind into the frame of that which has no mind; to imagine no imagination.
But see this, a process of deductive deconstruction, without motive or method:

Imagine first the mind of so-called 'lesser' beings; you are now a creature without intellect but not without thought.  All your thoughts are based on potential future actions, with none spent on past or abstracts or feelings. But you are still condemned to these remaining thoughts and actions by the simple truth of your existence: you still have a will.

And while—step back—your consciousness seems to force you to perceive the horrors of the world while your fleeting life-spans and separation of perceptions do no equip you to ail these ills, this new mentality, this 'lesser' functive brain would seem a logical response—the flight from fright and ignorance of this adrenal reaction bliss.

But if that were the case—why not opt for worldwide mandatory lobotomies?

No, the process is not over yet, but it has reached its final stage.

And though there are great schisms in what we would call a great connection: hot liquid motion in its center and cosmic force surrounding it in every direction for what seems to us eternity—and life itself existent upon its surface...

You are now a being not for itself but IN, and to this there was no opening and there will never be catharsis.

You are a rock, and you will never act, never think, and never feel.

But you are a being. Completely oblivious of even your own existence you travel unaware and neither condemn nor condone this existence itself. Surely this is the bliss that all our intellect has been working steadily towards: that fated hour when we shall exist as dust and join the universe in its beauty caring not for the memories we leave in conscious beings. When the reality itself of time and space will not exist for us the way we shall: forever.

See, what I ask of you is impossible.

The very fact that you are reading this means that—like all us humans—you have no hope of comprehending what it is to BE a planet: a neutron; a quark. But as humans and no other animals we can hope to better understand out dreams, and though I have no hope, I will understand if you still find only fear in thoughts of death, where and when I understand that I will...Finally... Feel... Peace...ǯ
