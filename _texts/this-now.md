_…MENTALLY… SELF-REFERENCED… MENTAL…_

##ILLUMINATION

_SEAMLESS; MERCILESS; UNREMITTING. PERSONAL; ABSTRACTION; CONNECTED AND BIFURCATED. STUBBLE AND WEEDS THAT GROW FROM SHAFTS OF LIGHTYEARS… I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULD NEVER DOUBT AGAIN; THE QUESTION TAKES ON NEW MEANING WITH THAT MASK STARING UP AT YOU. THE POWER, NOW; OF COMPREHENDING EFFECT; REVOLUTION. PARA EL SEGUNDO VENIR… THE CONTINUOUS NATURE OF THE THIRD REVELATION BETWEEN THE PAGES BETWEEN HER LEGS I IMMERSE MYSELF IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE PLANETS AND THE PURE SPINNING ENERGY OF LOVE… CREATION… REFLECTIONS. THAT I KEEP; THAT YOU SHOULD SEE AND CONCEIVE TO BEAM OUT. LIKE THE SUN… WHISPER… THROUGH GHOSTS IT_

##BLINDS ME

_EVEN ENTWINED BETWEEN THE WORDS… THE FRUIT OF CLOCKWORK FORBIDDEN FROM THE FIRST; I FREELY WILL YOU TO FINALLY FEEL… THE CYCLES CIRCLES SPHERES OF STATES PERCEIVED NATIONS… MENTALY ILL MENTAL ILLUMINATION._
