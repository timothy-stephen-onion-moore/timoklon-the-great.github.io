title: This; Now.

<br>

‘Through dark riddles and rhyming light refracted we follow from the first three; this, now; we combat and begin to draw, blood from stones, and sticks—past the halfway mark—but my colours are fading, see…’

‘A faded play, the mark of psychological migration patterns:

_EUKARYOTO; ANIMALIA; CHORDATA; VERTEBRATA; MAMMALISA; THERIA; PRIMATES; ANTHROPOIDEA; HOMINIDAE; HOMO._

With only our words; this, now; a neo-neolithic revolution: feed, and shit; and travel, and remain still: metaphysical regents of mental kingdoms…

‘One day we shall love as one; but it is not today and; this, now; shall be eternal.’
