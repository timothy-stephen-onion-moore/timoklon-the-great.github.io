title: Condescending white patriarchy
---

- can I please be
- a condescending white patriarch
- for a second
- because as is so abundantly evident
- as motivates all your struggle
- we have all the fucking power
- and we're not going to give it to you
- just because you ask us for it
- that isn't how this works
- you imbeciles
- you don't win fights by being nice
- by telling the truth
- especially not when your adversary
- can swat you like a fly
- hold a gun to the head of power
- he'll say take it all
- over my dead body
- so you'd better be prepared
- to pull that trigger
- but you're not
- are you
- you're the nice guys
- and that's why you're the underdogs
- and you'd better believe
- there isn't anything the man won't do
- to hold on to what he's got
- anything
- you understand
- so if you don't want to fall to his level
- and incite violence
- you meet him at his true level
- of assuming superiority to begin with
- you saddle up to him
- pretend to compromise
- make him like you
- then you fuck him in the arse
- and of course
- I would say that
- because I'm white and I'm a man
- don't segregate
- join us
- join the existent power
- I protect the established system
- like my precious genetics tell me to
- and here I am
- saddling up to you
- pretending to compromise
- making you like me
- and fucking you in the arse
