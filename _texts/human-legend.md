title: Hopes will have you crushed
---

<br>

Dregs of sanity delving down through. Holes in the side of a secluded dust track. Dead before his time. Heaven couldn’t reach the hedonism. Doors and hallways filled with ash and footsteps. Hell a long trudge and few drinks short of the present. Delve into the barrel, thrust and root out soothsayers of lucid ages. Holy men say what they mean. Don’t accuse them of more or less, they’ll string you up and down. Hook, line and they’re lines for the slaughter. Drugged by feelings that used to wave around like air, blown away with the sacrifice. Here, take this. Distance yourself from everything you’re about. Hopes will have you crushed. Dreams project on skies in different planets. Have and hold and learn to let go. Dent. History. Drips. Humanity. Droll. Helps to have friends. Dances of fury.

Home inside a casket. Death.

The H&D morbid spring sale.
