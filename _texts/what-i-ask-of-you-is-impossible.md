title: This is the first page

This is the first page. This face is only the foundation—what we would choose to build upon it is entirely up to us. This—the face of a blind man, is where everything began; only through his eyes can we now begin to see just how far we have come.

This journey, that seems eternal in its potential, that has only just now begun, in this instant. This moment: the spark that never seems to end—who can say what came before? This, this... now, that continues to continue forever, regardless of my external perception of it. This record of what we could call time—through our journey. This, understand; this right here: this is the end.

This is everything conceived all at once, just as everything is and was, and will. This is the re-combination of everything [??] by our inherent need to survive. This is the long awaited new humanity. Here.
