Tim was a very special person, highly intelligent, funny, creative, visionary, possessed of an exceptional, precocious and rare talent, and was an inspiration to many over the course of his short life.  He led his friends into various chaotic and exciting adventures. He was much admired and much loved. The pages of this website enable us to share some of Tim’s drawings and writings, photos of him and some of the many messages his family received following Tim’s untimely death. In spite of the tragic circumstances of his death and his bouts of loneliness and depression, there were long, joyous and happy periods, times of creativity, friendship, and belonging. Tim’s life was a rounded life and, as we have come to realise, there was a completeness and luminosity to it, as in Shakespeare’s ‘brief candle’. The candles which burn out most quickly are often the brightest.


Tim took his own life on Tuesday 30th August 2016. He had battled with suicidal feelings on many previous occasions but on this day, he lost.
