  <h1 class="post-title">In the distant future</h1>
  <p>In the distant future, the human race has travelled further out into the galaxy and set up colonies on a variety of planets through the [?] introduction of ecosystems, but no alien life has been discovered. Mankind has the capability to travel much further than it has and is in the process of gathering information from every solar system in the galaxy, hindered only by how much time it takes to reach new solar systems. Using a powerful form of sonar and still relying heavily on radio-waves, our spaceships observe new territories from a distance before entering them and always observe new planets from above the surface before attempting to land on them, to reduce the ever increasing risk of surprise encounters with potentially hostile new life-forms.</p>

<p>In sending out signals across [?] of these new solar-systems, which has become routine procedure after the sheer amounts of documented planets known to bear no life, for the first time a response is sent back to the ships receivers. It is coded and appears as gibberish at first, before being run through a computer which reveals its sense: it is a perfect recording of Beethoven’s 7th in A Major, Op. 92, II: Allegretto, note for note. The explorers and their superiors of course do not know what to make of this, especially since their own transmission reads only ‘Is anybody there?’ in all known human languages; we respond to the perplexing message containing our own music with more specific questions hoping that they will be understood: ‘Can you understand us?’; ‘Where are you exactly?’; ‘What are you?’; ‘How many of you are there?’: all of which results only in the reception of another identical transmission, a perfect recording of the theme from Beethoven’s 7th.</p>

<p>For a long time, during which much deliberation occurs, mankind’s explorers gather in their ships and remain anchored outside this solar-system, sending messages and receiving the same response, and debating whether or not to enter. Eventually it is decided that the message, though confounding, does not contain hostility, and one ship is given permission to enter the system and inspect the individual planets more closely. But there are only three, and yet again they are all devoid of life. Of course, this is not accepted and for decades explorers stay and pull apart those three planets searching for signs of where the transmission originated; similarly people across the universe study the transmission against our own recordings of Beethoven’s 7th and attempt to discover distinguishing characteristics to no avail. Centuries pass and the mass celebration over the discovery of alien life dwindles into an infuriatingly endless riddle-solving contest. Who has sent it? Why are they sending it? How have they come by it? It is not long before a mathematician and philosopher steps forward to explain the anomaly in physical terms: ‘the universe as per our understanding is that which contains all things. These things which it contains, which in being contained make up its existence, may be finite or infinite, as per our understanding. If, and only if, the universe is infinite and contains infinite things, then as per our understanding of how things exist structurally, many of those infinite things (indeed an infinite amount of them, for example stars) would need necessarily to be so similar to each other as to be indistinguishable by us from their counterparts, and so it should come as no surprise that the first example of life originating outside our own planet turns out to be exactly the same as something which we have already encountered here on Earth.’ Unfortunately this idea did not go any way towards explaining the origin of the transmission, and was therefore much less circulated than the idea that the solar system in question is one that will contain human colonies in the distant future when we have discovered time-travel, and that the transmission is in fact a practical joke committed by humans in a distant age. Eventually the notion of Beethoven’s 7thhaving been recorded and sent out as a message to other life-forms by another species who eveolved separately to our own became a ridiculous one, and none but the free thinkers ever entertained it.</p>

<p>Then, centuries after the transmission was first received, the first ruins were pulled up, along with the first examples of skeletal material. They were buried so far beneath the surface of the middle of the three planets that they were only just within the crust and they appeared as nothing more than rock, butwhen analyzed they were shown to be formed of similar substance to our own cities, or how you would imagine the material of an entire city would appear when collected and compressed with all bio-material included. Then plastics were pulled up, and patterns started to emerge. Maps were drawn up and compared, and excavations set-up mirroring the layouts and global positions of London; New York; Delhi; Tokyo. The planet was measured and weighed and discovered to be identical to our own Earth. After further centuries it was believed that potentially billions of years ago this planet contained life-forms, culture, and a history identical to (or at least indistinguishable form) our own.</p>

<p>This was too much. People started to go mad. All over the various coloniespeople began to decide that existence was a cosmic trick, that a God-like being did in fact exist but that whatever it was was far from merciful and benevolent, and took pleasure in creating these confounding anomalies, then watching us attempt to understand them. Many, however, devoted themselves to the study of the planet, which was named Castor; they set about trying to find the crucial differences. Of course there were many potential differences that required disproof, over and above the fact that the events of the life-forms of Castor occurred in a earlier time, which, if there were no causal link between Castor and our Earth, would mean that they in-fact occurred at the same time, despite the fact that it was billions of years after their deaths that we first arrived at the planet. Millennia of searching brought back billions and billions of examples which proved that Castor was identical to Earth, every potential difference was looked into and found to be the same: their planet and animal life in all stages of their evolution, the names of all their historical figures and all their languages and customs. Oddly, the one ascertainable difference was their demise. On Castor, everything occurred just as it had on Earth right up until their year 2050, and then it just stopped inexplicably. The winning argument was as ever for a meteor though no crater of corresponding size could be found. Some argued that their world had ended in the Biblical sense of the rapture, in which all the souls were transported to the realms of the dead and all the mortal shells were simply left to rot, which at that stage was as good an argument as any. Eventually, and though it took a very long time, everyone had to collectively just stop thinking about it and try to get on with their lives. It wasn’t possible to force the thought away, which only made it seem more pressing; the thought had to be engaged with upon occurrence to the minimum degree and then allowed, calmly, to pass on.</p>
