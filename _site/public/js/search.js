  content: "\nA million years from now some genius will discover a genetic marker for duplicity in living things. And, for want of a better word, they will call it intellect.\n\nMankind shall exist in a global and possibly multi-planetary state of collective anarchy; like the super-man we will take our energy directly from the sun and have no need for waste, and hypothetically this would seem to outrage any reason for harm: each other and ourselves.\n\nBut changes—history—a million years from now backwards in time some genius realized that our conception of ‘reason’ shall always render redundancy (?). And, unless we evolve into immortals; love shall always seem to give us reason.\n\nIt’s the perception. Our powers of observation; where the monkey sees a tree and we see beauty—makes room in concept for ugly.\n\nConquest.\n\nSix point three billion, approx.\n\nNot necessarily what is nice or enjoyable; but what is good—right—TRUE. As opposed to that which is bad, wrong, or false. If we could love without that perception—then, perhaps, there would be no difference. Every member of the animal kingdom bar only homo sapiens is enlightened beyond the dreams of any Buddha. Only—they were born that way. And we were born another.\n\nYou cannot learn to love everything. We have to eat, and shit. And dream. And sky. And even in a world without law in which no living thing were ever angry, or hungry, or frightened… we would still use each other. Through minor facial twitches, if nothing else. Every exerted expression some plea to our almighty consciousness—‘Am I not proven; father? Mother? Sister, brother?’ Have we not become; finally?\n\nEver?\n\nAnd despite the lack of proof—the lack of reason beyond subjectivity—annihilation still seems to me the only logical response—the only humane course of action. But if a voice were left to breathe the question, I would have no answer.\n\nStill now we have no answer.\n\nIs it conceivable—validfi and verifi—for ourselves? This freedom?\n\nWhy?\n\nNo.\n\nFollow this—and you are damned. Eat this book—and there never was a problem.\n\nGoat.\n",

It was said that men had travelled there in their thousands seeking to find out more about these people, but that none had ever returned.\n\nIt is only due to recent events that their story can now be told, and the story of the Minotaurs begins in a very different part of the world.\n\nIn the far south, deep in the jungles of Xuāqu’rlo, there had once been a vast empire of bull-headed men who worshipped and served the Emporer ‘Bull-God’ Urā-Khān, who used men as slaves and slaughtered them for sport, building temples from human skulls. It now lies in ruins, and the people of the land say it was the jungle itself that ensnared them.\n\nBut we have heard a different story. The prophet Jolensalin, who has come back to us after travelling through the region, has told us that even deeper into the jungle there is another race of men, who have become like lizards who inhabit the far depths of the jungle before the coast. He says that the two horribly mutated races fought constantly, and that eventually the reptilians must have fought off the Minotaurs, or, at least, their civilisation. He says that those we see in the north in that well defended land are the survivors, who not so much fled as retreated, to build and train an army capable of burning down the entire forest and slaying every lizard.\n\n1\n\nThis is how we imagine it would have first started.\n\nAnd now a kind word from Rag-Tun:-\n\n\n  ‘You have it all wrong, you fools! And now you will all kneel before your God the Mintoaur King Rag-Tun, and you will shed your blood for him, and you will give your life for him! ARRGH!’\n…This will all make sense, in time…\n…I’m sorry; we’re out of time…\n…Got any Kahlua?…\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Not sure if these are in sequence but it appears there’s a picture here and then underneath some more text. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n  \n\n",

  author: null,
  layout: "drama",
  content: "In the distant future, the human race has travelled further out into the galaxy and set up colonies on a variety of planets through the [?] introduction of ecosystems, but no alien life has been discovered. Mankind has the capability to travel much further than it has and is in the process of gathering information from every solar system in the galaxy, hindered only by how much time it takes to reach new solar systems. Using a powerful form of sonar and still relying heavily on radio-waves, our spaceships observe new territories from a distance before entering them and always observe new planets from above the surface before attempting to land on them, to reduce the ever increasing risk of surprise encounters with potentially hostile new life-forms.\n\nIn sending out signals across [?] of these new solar-systems, which has become routine procedure after the sheer amounts of documented planets known to bear no life, for the first time a response is sent back to the ships receivers. It is coded and appears as gibberish at first, before being run through a computer which reveals its sense: it is a perfect recording of Beethoven’s 7th in A Major, Op. 92, II: Allegretto, note for note. The explorers and their superiors of course do not know what to make of this, especially since their own transmission reads only ‘Is anybody there?’ in all known human languages; we respond to the perplexing message containing our own music with more specific questions hoping that they will be understood: ‘Can you understand us?’; ‘Where are you exactly?’; ‘What are you?’; ‘How many of you are there?’: all of which results only in the reception of another identical transmission, a perfect recording of the theme from Beethoven’s 7th.\n\nFor a long time, during which much deliberation occurs, mankind’s explorers gather in their ships and remain anchored outside this solar-system, sending messages and receiving the same response, and debating whether or not to enter. Eventually it is decided that the message, though confounding, does not contain hostility, and one ship is given permission to enter the system and inspect the individual planets more closely. But there are only three, and yet again they are all devoid of life. Of course, this is not accepted and for decades explorers stay and pull apart those three planets searching for signs of where the transmission originated; similarly people across the universe study the transmission against our own recordings of Beethoven’s 7th and attempt to discover distinguishing characteristics to no avail. Centuries pass and the mass celebration over the discovery of alien life dwindles into an infuriatingly endless riddle-solving contest. Who has sent it? Why are they sending it? How have they come by it? It is not long before a mathematician and philosopher steps forward to explain the anomaly in physical terms: ‘the universe as per our understanding is that which contains all things. These things which it contains, which in being contained make up its existence, may be finite or infinite, as per our understanding. If, and only if, the universe is infinite and contains infinite things, then as per our understanding of how things exist structurally, many of those infinite things (indeed an infinite amount of them, for example stars) would need necessarily to be so similar to each other as to be indistinguishable by us from their counterparts, and so it should come as no surprise that the first example of life originating outside our own planet turns out to be exactly the same as something which we have already encountered here on Earth.’ Unfortunately this idea did not go any way towards explaining the origin of the transmission, and was therefore much less circulated than the idea that the solar system in question is one that will contain human colonies in the distant future when we have discovered time-travel, and that the transmission is in fact a practical joke committed by humans in a distant age. Eventually the notion of Beethoven’s 7thhaving been recorded and sent out as a message to other life-forms by another species who eveolved separately to our own became a ridiculous one, and none but the free thinkers ever entertained it.\n\nThen, centuries after the transmission was first received, the first ruins were pulled up, along with the first examples of skeletal material. They were buried so far beneath the surface of the middle of the three planets that they were only just within the crust and they appeared as nothing more than rock, butwhen analyzed they were shown to be formed of similar substance to our own cities, or how you would imagine the material of an entire city would appear when collected and compressed with all bio-material included. Then plastics were pulled up, and patterns started to emerge. Maps were drawn up and compared, and excavations set-up mirroring the layouts and global positions of London; New York; Delhi; Tokyo. The planet was measured and weighed and discovered to be identical to our own Earth. After further centuries it was believed that potentially billions of years ago this planet contained life-forms, culture, and a history identical to (or at least indistinguishable form) our own.\n\nThis was too much. People started to go mad. All over the various coloniespeople began to decide that existence was a cosmic trick, that a God-like being did in fact exist but that whatever it was was far from merciful and benevolent, and took pleasure in creating these confounding anomalies, then watching us attempt to understand them. Many, however, devoted themselves to the study of the planet, which was named Castor; they set about trying to find the crucial differences. Of course there were many potential differences that required disproof, over and above the fact that the events of the life-forms of Castor occurred in a earlier time, which, if there were no causal link between Castor and our Earth, would mean that they in-fact occurred at the same time, despite the fact that it was billions of years after their deaths that we first arrived at the planet. Millennia of searching brought back billions and billions of examples which proved that Castor was identical to Earth, every potential difference was looked into and found to be the same: their planet and animal life in all stages of their evolution, the names of all their historical figures and all their languages and customs. Oddly, the one ascertainable difference was their demise. On Castor, everything occurred just as it had on Earth right up until their year 2050, and then it just stopped inexplicably. The winning argument was as ever for a meteor though no crater of corresponding size could be found. Some argued that their world had ended in the Biblical sense of the rapture, in which all the souls were transported to the realms of the dead and all the mortal shells were simply left to rot, which at that stage was as good an argument as any. Eventually, and though it took a very long time, everyone had to collectively just stop thinking about it and try to get on with their lives. It wasn’t possible to force the thought away, which only made it seem more pressing; the thought had to be engaged with upon occurrence to the minimum degree and then allowed, calmly, to pass on.\n\n",

  content: "For Auraz Yazan Budeiri\n\nThe station we pass through is nothing but one, great hall of intensely bright, white neon light from all directions. As I look up from my book (Jorge Luis Borges’ ‘Ficciones’) to check which station we are at I am temporarily blinded; when I look back down at the pages they are simply sheets of a shimmering purple-green and, though I blink furiously, no lettering emerges. The audio announcement calls out something (presumably the answer I was looking for) in some foreign tongue that I cannot make out; the doors close, and the whir and rattle of our hurtling journey begins, anew. Though I stare down at my shining novel that offers no diversion, I am acutely aware of each of my fellow passengers (in this carriage at least, for- contrary to statements I may have purported previously, in past monologues- I am not a mystic); a conglomeration of cultures; ages; moods; pasts, and futures. I try to force my mind to pay them no attention, but as no words leap up at me from the page I find myself feebly attempting to stumble into their psyches, through means ofquick and timorous glances in their general direction. The man directly opposite me is tall- that much I can tell without even looking up, his feet enter my vision just above the page-line- and, froma glance I shot as he entered a few stations back; South-American, or at least borne of a family that can trace their ancestry back to somewhere in that continent. I suppose Mexico is also an option, forthis one. Despite his size and obnoxious invasion of my line of sight I have glimpsed him fully a few times since  he entered, him sitting exactly where my eyes follow when I raise my head: he has not moved since he took his seat, and he is dressed all in black. His head faces downwards, staring at the space between his own feet; his look is one of intolerably passionate misery, and though his shoulders sway with the momentum of our subterranean vessel like the rest of us, he has not fidgeted or moved voluntary in any way, throughout his journey. Naturally I find this somewhat disturbing, and my instinct leans me toward reaching out to this man to ask him what is wrong- not with any hope of genuinely consoling him or any other altruistic motivation, more to purge my own curiosity- but my social determinism leans me toward the exact opposite. Either way, even as I wonder what may or may not be troubling him (perhaps he ‘just has one of those faces’) I cannot focus my full concentration on speculating over his mental state for- just as my book has been suppressed- I am distracted by a couple at the other end of the carriage, who are kissing. My glanceshere are sidelong so I cannot make out much of their features or dress other than that they are man and woman and they are both Caucasian, and both entirely lost in lust. Or at least, so it would seem with the first glance- but on the second I catch her hand restraining his and sense that they are both in fact aware of their environment and their onlookers; from what I witness I gather that she is not comfortable with this, whereas he appears to thrive off it. My attention was drawn over to them by the conversation of two male youths to my left who I have not deigned to look up at, from their voices they are from somewhere outside London (although as a firmly rooted local I could not tell you where); their dialogue is both incessant and irritating, and- come to think of it- gives good reason for why the man before me is stuck in such a depressive bodily state. They had been trying to remember when it was that one of their friends, whose name is Finn (who, it seems, has been having some difficulties recently), first started acting strangely towards them. This had been their topic for at least two stops hence, although I cannot be certain as I waver in and out of listening intently; until they noticed the couple, and both made a few quiet whistling noises and sordid jokes that lead me to look up and observe the couple. When I did look up, I was immediately terrified- notthat the couple would see me and think my interest perverse- but that one of these young men mightnudge me with an elbow and expect a similar sordid comment from me of the like they have been making. Fortunately this situation was (I think, narrowly) avoided, and I understand that my book isonce again my saviour; as the audio announcement calls out ‘we are now approaching…’ then drifts back into its usual alien dialect, I am able to decipher one sentence: ‘In some shelf of some hexagon,men reasoned, there must exist a book which is the cipher and perfect compendium of all the rest: some librarian has perused it, and it is analogous to a god.’\n\nThe motion has stopped and I foolishly raise my head in attempt of gaining the name of the station we are at, and am once again robbed of my vision. It occurs to me, suddenly, that I cannot recall which station is my destination; which line I am travelling on. I look up and great blobs of the purple-green ethereal essence flash everywhere; the couple have gone, and an older woman is taking a seat next to the man in front of me. The two to my left continually natter;- now, concerning a woman named Bethany who is a mutual acquaintance of them both, their perception of her misgivings, what she will or will not do, in bed- I glance up to my right and see hordes of human specimens previously unseen by me, but there are too many to take in with such short glimpses, andI decline my head. Resigned to staring at my once more empty sheets (and wondering now if anyone else has noticed that I sit here reading without ever turning the pages) I am ready to tune in to the habits and shortcomings of Bethany when I hear the sound of weeping and look up, now feeling justified in holding my head upright. The doors shut and the rattle picks up again and I instinctively turn back to my book before remembering what it was that lead me to look up, so look up again, at her. The older woman who has just entered, who also looks Hispanic; she wears torn blue denim jeans and a dark blue cardigan and has one of those things draped around her head; she is holding her face in her hands, crying. Our Mexican, who is sitting next to her: now he moves. He turns to face her, putting a hand on her shoulder, leans in, whispers something I can’t make out and she ignores him, unflinching in her melancholy. I stare at this little scene for what feels like years; him offering more soft words, attentive between pauses and glances forward at me and the two to my left; her never taking her hands away from over her eyes, quivering with emotion, apparently ignorant, or incapable of rectifying, the concern she is causing. After a spell I begin to feel even more wretched in my observation of this than I did glancing at the couple earlier, and try to break my gaze, but I can’t; I am locked, staring at these two; even the two to my left are speechless, and a little downcast (from what I can sense, through body language I make out with my peripheral vision). The door to the next carriage to my left slams and we are all broken out of our trance (save the older woman) momentarily, a haggard looking man; bearded, wearing old-style hat and trench-coat has entered, holding a bunch of pamphlets that he seems readying himself to hand out tous. Immediately the two to my left re-enter their squalid discourse; begin discussing which drugs they should take this eve for a rave they are headed to, and the Mexican turns back to his new foundcompanion, who is still crying. Having been ignored by each of these in turn the newcomer drops one of his pamphlets down on my book and mumbles something, as I look up he is already halfway down the carriage holding onto the rails, pulling himself forward by his hands like an ape. I look down again and see that it is not a pamphlet he has given me but a single card, all red with black lettering, that says simply: ‘VOTE REMI D.’ I turn the card in my fingers to see if there is anything prescribed on the back but there is nothing, and I am thinking… is there some new party I haven’t heard of, that is famous enough to not name itself and only its representative minister? … Who, or what, is Remi D.?\n\nI pocket the piece of card and look up at a new station emerges, the two to my left rise and exit; more still enter as I look down at the pages that offer no diversion, as I turn that name around and around in my head; and in a brief flash of dim enlightenment, suddenly, everything makes sense.\n",

  author: null,
  layout: "drama",
  content: "Mankind will always create myths for itself. Even or perhaps especially if those myths are substantiated by ‘proven’ fact. Observe the crocodile and how perfectly formed it is to perform all the various tasks that it performs. Now observe the human being, and I ask, why have we developed these ridiculous brains? Of course, factually, we know why or at least I have assumed (without consulting research, begging your pardons) that we have brain-capacity like a deer has antlers—in short we have always been at war without selves and higher intelligence once resulted in more chance of survival and propagation.\n\nI only say at war with each other because only when a mirror reflects itself is the image made eternal. In other words had we all been one group hunting mammoths then we would have become the perfect mammoth hunters, but we didn’t. I suppose my argument is that what human beings are is evolutionarily unprecedented when compared to hunting/evading predators or survival in general, but then so is a bird’s plumage in this regard. So, a deer could have spikes on its head to spike a wolf and all that would need to do was get longer or harder depending what the wolf does to compensate; but only when fighting another deer do the spikes become antlers. This is why we sacrifice ourselves in such great number in the name of war. We are each of us born fighting an instinctive battle to pass on our own genes, which once done we are free to relax and anticipate death, and it is from this secondary stance that the social formations of mankind are governed. The trick is not just to avoid war yourself, but to actively promote the existence of war and to persuade others to join in with it. This is what constitutes true sexual, racial, political, social religions: power. It is why we have a global ruling class, even though they themselves may not be aware of it. They are destined for a superior genetic class; global politics runs itself naturally, anarchic, like some fabled Nazi dream. Which, watered down or rather poured in the ocean—is, now, how natural selection mustfunction.\n\nMankind has always created myths for itself: arguably unnecessary is the wake of hunger and natural disasters but then so arguably is a bird’s plumage. But then, even, why ‘in the wake…?’ Humans do not need to be persuaded to band together, this again is survival instinct and altruism has been shown to have evolutionary benefits; it is only in instances of extreme danger or panic that self-interest kicks in. WHICH IS WHY WE ARE ALL SO OBSESSED WITH FEAR. The human capacity for self-delusion is extraordinary. We have so much to worry about, all for perfectly justified reasons and yet coincidentally this worrying in itself heightens our capacity for ignoring our more compassionate impulses. Global politics and media are us as a species shaping ourselves into our ideal, Godlike image: the ultimate survivalist, adaptation machine. Which machine, by the way, is known and generally accepted to serve a high power and guiding force, be that God or Truth or just the future, or the genes themselves.\n\nThe problem, and herein comes the delicacy in posing any kind of argument ever, is language. This is rudimentary but in case you’ve forgotten I’ll give you an example. One man from one part of the world worships God, who he says made him and the world; another man from elsewhere say he worships Bantu for the same reasons: here it is clear to anyone that God and Bantu are simply different sounds (words) that portray the same concept. However, and here’s the rub: another man says that in fact the big bang made the world and him and the other two and therefore God and Bantu, which are delusions. This is not new; people have always fought at cross-purposes or rather they have fought for the sake of fighting and the abundance of natural resource doled out to survivors in the wake of mass death, and they often use the same arguments (delusions; sounds) to justify this natural impulse. But still, science and colonization achieved something relatively new, which has been the mark of the modern world, although stems back presumably to the dawn of man, and can be summarized as ‘book-burning’. A tribe learns history, fact or fiction, they have a story that they believe and the objective world is irrelevant. The way to end all war is to eradicate the enemy tribe; not just beat them like before but to stamp them out: then they’ll stop attacking and we will be free to stagnate; and therefore govern, having excommunicated ourselves from our passion. To create a new word for something for which there was a word already but then, rather than to say that it is new and on-top (contributive for accumulative knowledge (fantasy; sounds)) e.g. ‘I no longer worship Bantu, now I worship God’; to say that your new sound refutes the existence of the old sound which had the same meaning completely, e.g. ‘I worship God and complicit in this idea is the idea that there never was a Bantu’. These are not just sounds at war, they do not make themselves; this is again the exercise of socio-political power: a culture war; the eradication of a human’s action/idea and by result the humans themselves (unless they change and join our group) that are perceived as or rather chosen to be perceived as: enemy. And that is (one reason) why language is a problem, because it has grown with us and like a dog or horse it’s ourmonster, only much bigger than us. Because, and though everything is arguably infinitely interpretable or rather the right proof can always be found to validate a myth that we want to create for ourselves, I use this here now for the same effect. I attack a perceived stance that I have seen in other humans, and I conveniently accuse them of adopting or being born with this stance without being aware of it. I seek to remove myself from it and make them harbingers of evil, and thus the myth is born. It is true that power corrupts but it must be remembered that just as there is no absolute power, so too is there no absolute absence of power.\n\n",

Before the return of Tempest and the floods following the choosing of the children of Hen’ry as the future of mankind, Twixiath lived and ruled in Twixia throughout the time of Sodom and Gomorrah; of Zion and the elder races of men. All of these he knew to be liars and heretics, for he and his disciples alone now knew the truth, and had walked amongst Tempest in the gardens of Merrydon, at the dawn of time. But Twixia was isolated and was not known of widely afore Twixiath was slain by the hand of his own second disciple, Mecusieth, and Twixia brought to ruin. The tale is always told of the journeys of his disciples following his death, of their missions to spread the word of Twixia throughout the ancient people of earth; of how truth and goodness was at each turn twisted, subverted and usurped—by the very liars and heretics who Twixiath had spent his daysalive trying to wipe out. But never before were the stories told of before Twixiath’s death, of how he lived and ruled amongst the other nations of his time—besides the infamous affairs of his mass genocides and executions. He was seen by many of the other rulers as a belligerent tyrant, a bully, who enjoyed his title only if it was used to the expense of lives of all free people. But he was feared, he was, after-all, the First Man; immortal, created by the Creator (Tempest) at the beginning of time to govern all men; created wiser and strongerthan any other could be. As he himself knew this to be the case, he saw himself as a liberator and a bringer of knowledge, [?] the extermination of al the liars and heretics of the time, whom he referred to as ‘filthy-good-for-nothing-pagans’. Amongst there he counted: the Jews, the Nephilim, all the tribes of Egypt and North Africa, all the tribes of mid and south Africa, the Persians, the Huns, the Ottomans, the Mayas, the Persians, the Huns and the other Mongols, the Gauls, the Franks, the Celts, the Vikings, the early Anglo-Saxons, the Slavs of northern Europe and the A[??] barbarians of the middle, even the tribes in the south who would become the Romans, even the tribes of North America, whom he knew of and had all intention of slaying. The only people he lived amongst peacefully for a time, aside his own people, were the people of the Far East, the ancient Empires of China and the war-bred people of ancient Japan; and even then he looked upon them with disdain for their lack of faith, and killed the most powerful of the leaders of the land while he resided there with his disciples Timoklon the Creator and George the Barbarian. Even after he left, George stayed and waged relentless war upon the people until the whole far-eastern land mass grew to fear the name of “King George’, as he had named himself, or ‘Genghis Khan’, as it translated to in their tongue. Genghis grew tired of his war eventually and travelled west unto the Dacean Empire, where he slayed a dragon and saved the people; so they proclaimed him new Emperor of Dacea after he had stricken the dragon into the sea of Dacea, which become black and was named ‘Ul Turu Thek’; the Black Sea. While George resided there he killed a wondering Viking called Ljefle for claiming to be the first man. He then grew restless and travelled to the island of the Anglo-Saxons, where he was called Saint George: established his cross, established the Templar Knights, and gathered his army of the crusades to head back east and cause more bloodshed under his new banner St. George’s Cross, which later became the flag of the nation of England.\n\nAnd while George Barbarus was time-travelling, Twixiath was dying, and not being re-born…’\n\nTEMPESTUS\n",

Of the only thing we truly know and feel to be right. Accept that and you are no longer a beast, but a King in Hell. Until, or unless, the second coming comes, so the moon can produce its own light and we can embody our true nature: the servants of heaven. It would take only one beam, one spark of starlight—but then it would also have to take the rest. It would, it will, and we continue to will, regardless of the raw power of our nature, of our duty, and our destiny. When the course of history has already passed infinite times in infinite spaces, it’s no wonder it seems fated. What is to non-? Is the aggressive expansion of animal evolution alongside the slow and steady progression of spinning, hurtling momentum that keeps our others’ halves from wanting; hungering in darkness. From the first burst to the collapse. We cannot hope to change that which is already written in stones surrounding nuclei of pasts or futures—but we can observe the life, and ask ourselves about how it pans out. All this progression; and is it ascension, or descension?\n",

It’s his own fucking fault.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: It’s not something I think I’ll be able to get over quite as easily as the other accidents we’ve had on set… I think mainly because Tim still refuses to tell me why the bear-trap was set up there in the first place, or why he ordered it, even.\n\nCut to room with S in bed and T standing at the window.\n\nS: Why was it there?\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: He’ll change the subject, or just walk away knowing I won’t be able to catch up with him…\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: That was one of the worst days, and there was consensus on that. There were a few arguments raised that it actually wasn’t as bad as the day in the home-made hot-air balloon because, well, only one person was hurt. Still I weighed the amount of pain I gauged Sam must’ve felt against those that fell, and the importance of what was lost. Personally I think the hair on Sam’s head- let alone his fucking leg- ‘s worth twice as much as a few fucking extras.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: … Now more than anything I just wish he’d give it back.\n\nCut to LS of T getting out of a car, putting on sunglasses, reaching into car and pulling out dismembered leg, swinging it over his shoulder, walking OS. Cut to T in the chair, with the leg.\n\nT: Yeah, they say they’ve got a way of reattaching it… (laughing), I don’t see it, no.\n\nCut to- Day 4- R holds cam to face.\n\nR: I’ve got a feeling we’re gonna get some serious truth this morning fellas, but (placing camera in hidden spot) the secrecy of the… documentation… must be… preserved.\n\nR steps back, knock on door, T enters.\n\nR: Alright Tim.\n\nT: Yeah, listen man I’ve just got word back from our fund-raising committee and, well, we’re broke man. Flat out broke.\n\nR: I see.\n\nT: … So I’m gonna need you to-\n\nR: Need me to what?\n\nT: … Do that thing you do when we run out of juice.\n\nR: … And what would that be?\n\nT: … Do you have the camera on in here?\n\nR: … No.\n\nT: … Alright. Stop trying to make me say it then. Go do your thing.\n\nExit T, R approaches cam.\n\nR: It’s fucking on.\n\nCut to R holding cam to face walking down posh residential street.\n\nR: Nice ‘ouses round ‘ere. They won’t know what ‘it ‘em. Now to pick a winner, and wait… for cover of night…\n\nCut to J in the chair.\n\nJ: I still can’t explain it. It was like magic, or something. Every time our funds ran out, without fail, they were immediately replenished the very next day, often to more than what we’d started with. And whenever I’d ask Tim how it was possible he’d always just say-\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: Fortune favours the bold.\n\nCut to shot of loose swag lain out on table, R holding cam moving it over items.\n\nR (OS): See what we’ve got tonight, got some doorknobs look like real brass… some jewellery here… what’s that… oh yeah I grabbed a sandwich from the fridge, ah it’s gone all mushy-\n\nCam moves up as T enters, looks at swag, looks up at R.\n\nT: … Good catch?\n\nR (OS): Yeah not bad at all man, coupla hundred here I reckon.\n\nT: Turn the fucking camera off.\n\nCut to S in the chair. Long pause.\n\nS: Of course I knew about it. I wasn’t told, but it was obvious. I don’t give a fuck where the money comes from.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: I did a church this one time. You always think churches’d be full of shit worth nicking, don’t you? Not so. Not a sausage. Committed a cardinal sin for a few pence in the donation box.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: I don’t know his name. He hangs around the set sometimes. I would never condone anything like that.\n\nCut to -Day 5- Beto in the chair- suit; glasses, clipboard; pen.\n\nB: I was called in by the producers fairly early on, just to interview the cast and crew and, well, just find out what was going on really.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: This guy shows up, I was like- who the fuck is this?\n\nCut to shot of B entering room with briefcase, R holds cam.\n\nR (OS): Who the fuck is this?\n\nCut to shot of B sitting with S in make-up room, R holds cam.\n\nB: So Sam, sorry this is my first question, but you’re the first person I’m interviewing and I feel I should know- what’s the film about?\n\nS: I’m sorry?\n\nB: What’s the film about?\n\nS: Oh. Er… it’s… I don’t think it’s really the kind of film that’s about anything.\n\nB looks up at cam, cut to shot of corridor R holding cam walking towards T carrying papers.\n\nR (OS): Tim! I want to know what that fucker’s doing here. We don’t need another interviewer. He’s got me documenting his fucking interviews!\n\nT: I know, I know. Tell you one thing for certain, he’s not just here for interviews, is he? … I think they might be on to us, man.\n\nR (OS): … Shit. … What do we do?\n\nT: Pre-emptive strike.\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: I found it very hard to glean any information… from anyone. After my first- fruitless- interview with Rossi-Harris everyone else just refused to speak on the record… The director is nowhere to be found… I don’t usually like to give up on anything but this does seem like a hopeless situation, to me.\n\nAs he is speaking R is gradually creeping up behind him wielding a large spanner. Cut to T in the chair.\n\nT: It’s tragic really.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: We were relying on that guy for the DVD extras, and he seems to have just deserted us. The wanker. I just hope to god this fucking video-diary doesn’t get put together by that fucking crackhead.\n\nCut to shot in basement of B tied to chair and gagged, laser-sight aimed at his forehead. R walks onto shot, sits behind B, leans forward.\n\nR: … You just don’t get it, do you boy?\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: I dunno, a mate told me about some temp work, good money, good hours, good people-\n\nCut to shot in basement of Raz &amp; B tied up and gagged, R stands over them holding whip. Cut to T in the chair.\n\nT: No, it is tragic.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: We get a lot of these young guns in here, since the ad we put up in the paper. They’re never with us long, but I’m told their input is invaluable.\n\nCut to R in the chair, with dog.\n\nR: ‘s gotta get his nutrients from somewhere, hasn’t he? Eh? Who’s a good boy?\n\nCut to -Day 6- R holds cam and approaches T &amp; J in the larger room standing over laid out tent.\n\nR (OS): Alright Tim. What’s this?\n\nT: Still making that fucking diary are you?\n\nR (OS): Jenine, what is it you’re doing here?\n\nJ: We’re making a hot-air balloon Ryan.\n\nR (OS): What for, Jenine?\n\nT: Aerial shots. Can you get that thing out of my face please mate, we’re trying to work.\n\nR (OS): How’s it going to work, then?\n\nT: … We’ve got the tent, and a blowtorch, and a shitload of string. All we need now’s a basket.\n\nR (OS): I’ve got a basket.\n\nT: Do you?\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: Things got out of hand so rapidly that day that I don’t think any of us realised we’d gone too far, until it was already too late.\n\nCut to R holding cam showing T attaching string to basket.\n\nT: Can you give me a hand over here Jenine?\n\nJ walks on screen with B and Raz following.\n\nJ: Tim I found these two in the basement-\n\nT: These fucking guys. Alright, load ‘em up, we’re almost ready for a trial run.\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: I didn’t sign up for this shit. No sir.\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: I think I was by that point well past being surprised by anything they did… I hadn’t spoken to my family in weeks, everyone probably just assumed I was dead.\n\nCut to B &amp; Raz being tied into basket by T &amp; J, R holds cam.\n\nT: Alright, hold still now. (Raises blowtorch).\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: When we were on the roof and it was about to take off, Tim takes the camera off me and says it needs to go up with them for the aerial shots, right. Understandably I pointed out that they were tied up so couldn’t film anything, right. So then, he decided to go up with them. I said Tim, this is a mistake.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: I was surprised they fit the first two into that basket, it didn’t look big enough. We all thought it was a bad idea to send them both up first time, and Tim getting in with them… well that was just suicidal. He must’ve known that. Sometimes I think a lot of what he does is just some elaborate plan to end it all and make it look like a really stupid accident… I mean, where did he get the idea that you can make a hot-air balloon out of a tent?\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: As we were taking off it was clear that everyone was right and it wasn’t going to hold the weight. I did what any sensible man does in that situation, and I dived out. It wasn’t far to the roof, you know, few grazes, but I was alright. Those other two weren’t able to get out as quickly as me though, and the wind was picking up just as I jumped out-\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: Nine months physical rehabilitation. Nine months. I broke five ribs; both legs; my skull was fractured in three places-\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: Yeah the runner I was in there with was in a really bad way when we landed. I can’t really remember, I was unconscious, but they tell me I must’ve landed on him- I had next to no wounds, and he was… well he is still pretty messed up.\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: -I’ve got two hernias and two new hips; I’ve lost seven toes; for eight weeks my spine was twisted so badly I couldn’t even lay down straight-\n\nCut to shot of Raz laying across a right-angled bed. Cut to Raz in the chair wearing eye-patch.\n\nRaz: -And let me tell you, this eye-patch ain’t a fucking fashion statement neither.\n\nCut to LS (from roof) of broken basket and Raz &amp; B sprawled out on the road, R holds cam and whistles.\n\nS (OS): Shall we call an ambulance?\n\nT (OS): … Can we explain this?\n\nJ (OS): I’m calling an ambulance.\n\nT (OS): Wait, wait, just let me go down to them first, smooth things over. (cam moves up shows T walking OS).\n\nR (OS): We’ve got to get this people.\n\nBlurred vision of R chasing T down fire escape into street, cam stops over T kneeling over Raz, trying to wake him.\n\nT: Fuck.\n\nR (OS): He dead?\n\nT: No, it ain’t that, it’s just we’re not insured for this. Fuck. Fuck. Alright I need to make a phone call. Turn the camera off.\n\nR lowers cam but does not turn it off.\n\nT (OS): … Yeah man it’s me. Not so good. There’s two of them this time. Yeah, same place. Drive in the back way, alright? … Help me get them inside, man.\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: I woke up… in the trunk of a car, tied up, with the runner still in a very bad way next to me. A few seconds later I realised there was water getting in, and we were both going to drown if I didn’t find a way out. Fortunately I’d had quite a long day in the sun with the magic arts when I was younger, and Houdini’s classic has always been one of my favourites. Saved the day, really, the outcome could very well have been a very different one.\n\nCut to Pierre in the chair.\n\nP: Tim calls me up sometimes with odd jobs for the film shit he does, it’s easy money. Sometimes the jobs are a bit weird, but I’m not one to complain about that. Did I know, when he asked me to drive the car into the lake, that there were two guys in the trunk? No, no I didn’t. If I had known, would I have refused to do it? For forty quid? Probably not. It’s only a bit of water sport. If he was asking me to kill ‘em I’d’ve asked for more but… well to be honest I assumed they were already dead. When I heard… that they was in there, anyway.\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: Mother-fucker tried to kill me. Kill me?! I’ll show him who the mother-fucking killer is around  here… (produces hidden blade, stands, stabs the air, makes crazy noises.) You wanna tango with the Raz-man, man? I’ll show him. See how I dance… mother-fucker. You talkin’ to me? You talkin’ to me?! Well I don’t see anyone else around here, so – (some of this should definitely be in slow motion.)\n\nCut to Raz in hospital bed, eyes closed, R holds cam, creeping in.\n\nR (OS): You’ve spoken-\n\nRaz: Who’s there?\n\nR (OS): Evening Raz. You’ve spoken about wanting to kill the director, both off screen and now on screen as well… just how serious are these plans?\n\nRaz: I’m gonna kill him.\n\nCut to T sitting with S over script, R approaches holding cam.\n\nS: I don’t like this bit.\n\nR (OS): Tim, the runner we crippled is laying up in there healing and making all kinds of threats. What do you say to his claim that he will kill you when he’s better?\n\nT: Go away man, we’re busy.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: No, I didn’t think the threats were genuine, and no, I never made a connection between the letters I received and what had happened to the runner that day. I’d heard what the crackhead told me he’d said… you say things like that when you’re hurt, but he’s a good kid. I’m sure by now he’s all healed and back to running for a nice reputable director, and he’s forgotten all about his little escapade with us.\n\nRaz leaps into shot and stabs T in the chest.\n\nRaz: Yeah. How’s that feel? How you like me now, bitch?\n\nT reels off chair and Raz stands over him with the blade, breathing heavily. Cut to S in the chair.\n\nS: It was the passing of a titan. Can’t say he didn’t have it coming.\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: He died almost as gracefully as he lived. He was a worthy adversary, I’ve nothing but respect, and forgiveness, and regret-\n\nT approaches from behind and quickly breaks Raz’ neck.\n\nCut to -Day 7- T in the chair.\n\nT: It was shortly after the first attempt on my life that strange things started to happen on set. I mean, stranger than usual. Paranormal, you could say.\n\nCut to shot of doorway, R holds cam, cam spins round on R, R steps back.\n\nR: It’s fucking floating… how’s it doing that?\n\nCut to J in the chair.\n\nJ: First thing was the chairs moving around, that was a little spooky, then it went after the weapons and we realised, you know, this could get very dangerous.\n\nCut to shot of samurai swords floating down corridor.\n\nR (OS): Where are these guys off to then?\n\nFollows swords into make-up room where S looks up from floor; screams. Cut to B in the chair.\n\nB: Folks were calling it the runner’s ghost… I’ll be honest, I never witnessed anything like what they were all talking about… I spoke to Rossi-Harris and, well… I wouldn’t be surprised if they’d just made the whole thing up in some desperate attempt to explain all the accidents.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: It’s not the first time he’s done this. And if he isn’t stopped, it won’t be the last time either.\n\nCut to P in the chair.\n\nP: Yeah I was down there, helping to move some shit, suddenly there was bodies everywhere-\n\nCut to P in garage dropping bag of swag, looking around.\n\nR (OS): Pierre, what is it?\n\nP: … You seeing this shit, man?\n\nCut to P; T; J in office heads bowed, R holds cam.\n\nR (OS): So does anyone here have previous experience of dealing with a poltergeist?\n\nAll look up. Cut to T in chair.\n\nT: Regrettably it does seem to happen pretty often in this business, but that never makes it any easier. I tried to dissuade the crew from thoughts that what was happening might be somehow connected to the recent death of our runner- Raz, I think his name was.\n\nCut to P; T; J in office, R holds cam.\n\nT: Stop calling it the runner’s ghost, it’s not the runner’s ghost.\n\nP: Well it’s not red fucking indians is it Tim?\n\nCut to Raz in the chair, wearing neck brace.\n\nRaz: I’d like to think I had a hand in it, yeah. Practising voodoo over a great distance. I can’t have been there as a ghost though, mainly because I’m not dead. I think I was in Burma at the time.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: It was the first time we’d ever called in a priest to deal with it, I don’t think it’d ever gotten that far before. I think that only happened though because that guy Pierre actually believed there was a ghost, and the distress that he was in… for whatever crazy reason… well it began to effect all of us.\n\nCut to the larger room, T; S; J stand around set, R holds cam. P enters, screams, lies prostrate on the floor.\n\nP: When’s he getting here? When’s he getting here?\n\nT: Alright man he’ll be here, he’ll be here. (Turns to J) Call a fucking priest.\n\nCut to J in the chair.\n\nJ: Tim asks me to call a priest. I didn’t know what to do, I’d never called a priest before, so I call directory inquiries and ask to be put through to the nearest priest. Going in like that I never expected to get through to anyone high up, but the next person I spoke to was the Bishop. He wasn’t of any regular church though, some outlandish one, I can’t remember the name now.\n\nCut to shot of B sitting with Hosman in make-up room, R holds cam.\n\nB: So you’re a Bishop?\n\nH: (Nods).\n\nB: And… you’ve come to help us eradicate the evil that besets us?\n\nH: (Nods).\n\nB: … Do you actually believe that there is an evil spirit dwelling in this place?\n\nH: - Do you believe in destiny?\n\nCut to H in the chair.\n\nH: I take my job very seriously. There is no demon I cannot slay; no spirit I cannot banish. When I am called to take on the seeds of Lucifer, I believe that it is fate that I have been called, God telling me that it is time for the evil to perish. … And if I arrive to find that there is no evil… that some punk kids have wasted my precious, sacred time on this beautiful earth on a hoax… then I show them even less mercy than I would the legions of hell. I make an example of them, to all the other would-be usurpers.\n\nCut to shot of H entering larger room, R holds cam, P runs to H.\n\nP: Father, thank God-\n\nH: Get back, Satan!\n\nCam blurs and whatnot as R runs through corridor to other room where T; S; J sit around desk.\n\nR (OS): The Bishop’s gone crazy. I think he’s killing Pierre.\n\nT: Oh for fuck’s sake.\n\nMore blurred movements; screams; crashes and clangs of swords.\n\nH (OS): The power of Christ-\n\nCut to P in the chair.\n\nP: For me, it was like, out of the frying pan of, y’know, horrible visions, and into the fire, of, well… this fucking nutjob of a Bishop. I remember thinking Pierre, you’ve had a good run, everyone’s got to die sometime, now’s just your time, is all.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: There’s no use in trying to describe it. I could only get a glimpse of what was going on before he knocked me down. Here it is in slow motion.\n\nCut to slow-motion shot of H standing over P with flaming broad-sword raised. Cut to S in the chair.\n\nS: He was unstoppable. If what Jenine says is true, then it is genuinely frightening who you can get if you go looking for a priest through directory inquiries. I don’t know how he was concealing that sword on his person; I don’t know how he set it on fire; I don’t know where the shotgun came from; and I definitely can’t explain all the levitation.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: We owe a lot to that guy the producers sent to us, I can’t recall his name. I didn’t really trust him in the beginning but, if it wasn’t for him, none of us were getting out of that situation alive.\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: Yeah, well, I spent five years in the jungle, in Peru, with a tribe that I won’t name; they taught me a few rare martial-arts techniques which are supposed to be… well there’s no defence to them, basically; if I’m coming at you with one of those attacks, there isn’t anything you can do.\n\nCut to H in the chair.\n\nH: There was one there that I did not see, and he won that battle. But the war isn’t over. My vengeance will be swift, and decimating.\n\nCut to -Day 8- R holds cam to face, walking down street.\n\nR: Alright today I need to get away from that horrible place, and get very, very loaded. Figured I’d keep the diary going though, while I’m about my business, see what the man on the street has to say about all this.\n\nTurns camera to show Jack walking down street; long coat; scarf; briefcase.\n\nR (OS): Excuse me, sir-\n\nJk: No, no, I’m sorry.\n\nR (OS): You what?\n\nJk: I’m in a rush, I’m sorry.\n\nR (OS): You don’t even know what I was gonna ask you.\n\nMoment of silence as Jk continues walking and R zooms the camera after him, then begins to chase him. We see Jk look over his shoulder and the fear in his eyes, then see only blurred movements, with the sounds of combat.\n\nJk (OS): Oi! Oi!\n\nR (OS): Yeah? Yeah?!\n\nCut to shot of Jk’s face unconscious, R stands over him holding cam.\n\nR (OS): Yeah. And let that be a lesson to all you ne’er-do-wells-\n\nJk’s eyes shoot open and he leaps at cam; more combat sounds. Cut to shot of pavement, R picks up cam and turns to mashed-up face.\n\nR: Mother-fucker must’ve hit and run. Man. Alright, now I’m gonna go get loaded.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: I gave him a few extra quid and sent him off, there was something scheduled for that day that I didn’t want him around for.\n\nCut to Frank in the chair.\n\nF: Yeah I sell the man his drugs; I get him what he needs. Thing I like about Ryan is that whatever I give him he always has a great time. I could sell him fucking chalk and he’d be bouncing off the walls saying it was the shit.\n\nCut to shot of F opening door, R holds cam.\n\nF: Yes yes mate, what’ll it be today?\n\nR (OS): What you got?\n\nF: Ah you’ll love this shit mate. You making a movie?\n\nR (OS): Yeah.\n\nF: Well don’t show no pigs yeah, I’ll be in a world of trouble.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: One of the producers was coming down that day, so Tim sent Ryan off to his dealer, and I seconded that. It was a good move. Unfortunately the inevitable is always inevitable, I’ve found.\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: Fucking crackheads. If I find out that he had any part in the making of this fucking film, I’m gonna go ape-shit. Heads are gonna roll.\n\nCut to shot entering larger room, R holds cam &amp; F walks in before him; T stands with Enri and S &amp; J stand on the other side of the room.\n\nT: What the fuck’re you doing back? What the fuck’s he doing here?\n\nR (OS): Alright Tim.\n\nT: Fuck outta here, man, if the producer sees you he’s gonna go ape-shit. Give me the camera. … (OS) Alright Frank, got any that sticky black left?\n\nF (OS): Nah mate it’s long gone.\n\nT (OS): Alright.\n\nT turns cam to face E.\n\nT (OS): So what makes you think you’re qualified to be a runner?\n\nCut to E in the chair.\n\nE: I always work well under pressure; I’m dedicated; I’ve got strong legs-\n\nCut back to T holding cam.\n\nT (OS): Your first task, I want you to go upstairs and find the producer, take the camera, ask him to describe the bloke who attacked him this morning. And while he’s describing him to you, I want you to try to confuse him as much as possible.\n\nE: … Alright. How?\n\nT (OS): I’m not a mathematician, Henry, alright, you can’t ask me these questions, just do it.\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: The guy who jumped me, the crackhead, yeah, he was definitely wearing a blue coat. I told the kid that and he was taking notes, but as he was saying what he was writing he said ‘red coat’, right? I said no mate, he was wearing a blue coat.\n\nCut to E in the chair.\n\nE: I don’t know if I was confusing him, I was definitely making him angry. I just kept saying the opposite of what he was telling me, but as if that is what he’d told me, y’know?\n\nCut to shot of Jk with wet towel on forehead sitting next to B, E holds cam.\n\nE (OS): So a blonde guy, about four foot six, with a red coat and green trousers?\n\nJk: … No. I’ve not told you any of those things.\n\nSound of door opening, cam swings round as F pokes head in.\n\nF: Pills, anyone?\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: Come on. I didn’t know he was the fucking producer did I? What’s he doin’ round these parts anyway? Should’ve stayed home, shouldn’t he? I can’t be held responsible for what I do to the monkeys I find out on my streets.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: … Inevitable.\n\nCut to shot of B approaching T; S; J in larger room, E holds cam following B.\n\nB: Tim? Jack wants a word.\n\nT: We’re really busy at the moment.\n\nS: Just go see him, Tim.\n\nT: (Sighs, turns to E) Go find Ryan, tell him to go get Pierre, and tell them we might have a live one.\n\nB: … You’re going to kill him aren’t you?\n\nT: (To E) Go.\n\nBlurred shots of building as E leaves room goes through corridor into boiler-room where R &amp; F sit with spliff.\n\nE (OS): Tim wants you to go get Pierre. Says you might have a live one.\n\nR: … Pierre’s on ‘olidays. And I don’t do murder no more.\n\nF: Word.\n\nMore blurred shots as E leaves and comes to a room in which T &amp; Jk sit and B stands, T with head bowed.\n\nJk: It’s a simple question, Tim, where’s the money going? That’s all I want to know.\n\nT: I understand that, your request is completely reasonable. (Turning round to E) -What?\n\nE (OS): … He says Pierre’s on holiday. And he won’t do it.\n\nT: (Sighs) Get Jenine up here, will you?\n\nMore blurred shots as E travels to J, brings her to previous setting.\n\nJk: Alright, so what have you done with it?\n\nJ: … Tim?\n\nT: Jenine. Get me the Bishop.\n\nB &amp; J: No.\n\nJ: I wouldn’t even know how-\n\nT: I don’t care how you do it, just get him here. We’ll deal with the consequences later.\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: At that point I found myself again questioning where my loyalties should lie… I mean in the beginning they were all awful to me, just awful, but we’d all come together through the course of events and, well… we had a common enemy in the Bishop. I was prepared to help out Tim with Jack and even lie on his behalf, just to help everyone fend off the Bishop, and here was this maniac actually trying to bring him back.\n\nCut to H in the chair.\n\nH: I got the call. It wasn’t fate calling, it was that woman from the film set. I do not doubt that they will pay for their crimes, in this life or the next, but it is not time for my vengeance yet. That much, God has told me.\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: I was this close to shutting the whole thing down. I’d been attacked, I was feeling shit, the set was terrible… Tim’s going on about this fucking Bishop character… It was a shambles. Total shambles. … Come to think of it I can’t remember why I didn’t.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: Something hit me, while they were up there talking about the funding. I suddenly realised that if I didn’t take the initiative, the whole project was going to fall through. I couldn’t have that. About ten weeks before I’d taken a beginners’ class for hypnosis-\n\nCut to shot of Jk sitting down with eyes closed, S stands in front of him, T; B; J stand around, E holds cam.\n\nS: You’re not going to shut it down though, are you?\n\nJk: … No. I wouldn’t.\n\nS: That’s right. That’s good. And you can’t remember what that crackhead looked like now, can you?\n\nJk: … No. Dammit.\n\nS: Okay. So when I click my fingers you’re going to stand up, walk outside, go to the train station, and get on a train. When the doors close and the train takes off, you will wake up. Understand?\n\nJk: … Yes.\n\nS clicks his fingers and Jk stands and sleepwalks out of the room.\n\nT: Thank fucking Christ.\n\nCut to -Day 9- E in the chair.\n\nE: I’d never done this sort of work before so I don’t know if the tasks they set me were abnormal or not… well, some were clearly abnormal, but most of the time I was just running between the druggie and his dealer. Not the most exciting or the safest job in the world, but it kept me off set, and I was avoiding one of the actors, who was always being a dick to me, for some reason.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: Sam just took an instant disliking to Henry. I, nah… I don’t know what his problem is. He gets like this, sometimes.\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: It was prejudice. Nothing more, or less, than prejudice. I asked him why he hated the new runner so much, the arrogant prick comes back with-\n\nCut to S in the chair, arms folded.\n\nS: I don’t need a reason.\n\nCut to shot of T &amp; J standing over papers on desk, R holds cam, S storms in.\n\nS: We need a new runner.\n\nT: Why, what’s he done?\n\nS: It doesn’t matter what he’s done, we need a new runner.\n\nR (OS): You’ve not raped and killed him ‘ave you? Spur of the moment like?\n\nT: … Have you, Sam?\n\nS: No. Can you just fire him and get a new runner please?\n\nT: What’s your beef with him?\n\nS: Can you just fire him?\n\nT: I’m not firing him unless you tell me what your beef is.\n\nCut to S in the chair, he sighs deeply. Cut to E in the chair.\n\nE: There were moments… I wanted to smack him, and it was hard to hold back. He was being such a dickhead. I like this job, though, y’know, I don’t want to give it up over one dickhead.\n\nCut to S in make-up room, R holds cam, E enters with coffee.\n\nS: You remember what I asked for yeah?\n\nE: Americano, three sugars, no milk.\n\nS: Good. (Throws the coffee on the floor). Now clean it up.\n\nE: I-\n\nS: Clean it up!\n\nCut to E in the chair, shaking his head. Cut to S in the chair.\n\nS: … He came to me one day and just asked me, straight up, why I was being like that to him. That took courage. I couldn’t tell him, but I did apologise; and the truth is… (sighs) … the truth is he… he bears a striking resemblance to a lover who passed away, and… well it’s just a little painful for me, having him on the set all the time.\n\nCut to E in the chair.\n\nE: I still don’t know what his problem is. I don’t care. He’s a dickhead.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: I would’ve been like… you clean it up. You’re the one bloody knocked it over, ain’t you? Prick.\n\nCut to shot of set; T; J; S; E stand around, R holds cam, moving it between S &amp; E. George enters, looking dazed.\n\nT: Who the fuck’re you?\n\nG: I own the building. Who the fuck’re you, and… what the fuck’s going on?\n\nLong pause. T reaches slowly for the radio-mic at his belt. Cut to T in the chair, holding radio-mic.\n\nT: Fucking nifty these things.\n\nCut back to shot of G and the others, zoom in on T as he raises the radio-mic.\n\nT: Pinky, come in, over. … We have a 10-64 over here, over… This is not a drill, over… Pinky?\n\nCam moves down to radio-mic at R’s belt, then up to T looking at space above cam (R) with unmistakable fury.\n\nR (OS): Well he’s still on ‘oliday, ain’t he? No point letting it go to waste.\n\nT: … Not too much use if you’re in the same fucking room as I am, is it?\n\nAnother long pause. Zoom out as everyone backs away from G towards the door.\n\nG: Where are you going? What the fuck’s going on? … Who let you in here?\n\nT: Run!\n\nEveryone runs out the door, G stands looking bemused, turns to cam, R then begins to back away. H then enters with eyes closed.\n\nG: Who the fuck’re you?\n\nH: (Drawing sword) … In nomine patris, et fili, et spiritus sancti-\n\nCut to G in the chair.\n\nG: I did not have a fucking clue what was going on. I’d only been gone ten days, and they must have really worked to have gotten the place into that state in that amount of time. The mind boggles, but the question remained- who were these people, and why were they doing this to me?\n\nCut to H in the chair.\n\nH: Finally, finally the hour comes that the Lord tells me it is time to carry out my vengeance. But… when I open my eyes…\n\nCut back to shot of G &amp; H, H opens eyes.\n\nH: … You are not one of them.\n\nG: One of them?\n\nH: (Looking up at camera) You! (Charges towards cam with sword).\n\nR (OS): Oh shit.\n\nG: Wait! What the fuck’re you doing? You’re a priest aren’t you? You can’t kill him!\n\nH: I am a mighty demon-slayer, and this, is a demon!\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: I don’t scare very easily… usually… I mean I’ve faced the fact that there are moments in The Wizard of Oz that I will never be able to sit through comfortably, but this was different… all you have to do is look into the Bishop’s eyes; see all that hate and… well my bowels have never done well in tight situations.\n\nCut back to shot of G &amp; H.\n\nH: See how he defecates himself to mock us? A common tactic of the minions of the Prince of Darkness. I need feel no remorse in destroying this foul creature.\n\nG: He’s just a man. You kill him and I’m calling the police.\n\nH: The police?! (Charges at G, G screams).\n\nCut to T in the chair, wiping sweat from forehead and breathing out heavily, then smiling and looking relieved.\n\nCut to -Day 10- E holds cam to face, walking down corridor.\n\nE: Morning all. Ryan’s off to see his dealer at minute, and not much is happening, so I’ve been given video-diary privileges. Now if I can just find where they’ve all bloody gotten off to-\n\nUnmistakable slamming sound of the bear-trap is heard and cam falls with E amidst screams. Cut to T; S; B; J in the same outside hospital shot as the last bear-trap incident.\n\nB: … You say this isn’t the first time this has happened?\n\nCut to S in the chair, he taps his knee and it emits a wooden sound. Cut to B in the chair.\n\nB: I’d begun to see the… purpose, to the whole thing by that point. I wanted to see this film made, so I didn’t feel all that bad about lying to Jack, or having the site-owner taken out by the Bishop, but… one thing we needed was a safety inspector. At the very least, someone should have gone round and un-set all the bear-traps that were set up around the place because people were almost always walking around not looking where they were going-\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: Sam once asked me why the bear-traps had been set up, and I couldn’t answer him. I couldn’t remember if they were already set up when we got there, or if I’d set them up. I don’t remember setting them up, but I can’t be certain that I didn’t, and if I were to say ‘no’, then it turns out I actually did, well… you know how he gets about shit like that. It wasn’t worth the risk.\n\nCut to G in the chair.\n\nG: Yeah, well… obviously I don’t regret setting them up before I left, clearly they were necessary. Lot of bloody good it did me. I should’ve set up proximity mines, is what I should’ve done. I would gladly have lost the property and claimed the insurance if it meant an end to that crazy fucking priest. (Raises shirt showing scar) – He fucking ran me through! A fucking priest; a Bishop, no less!\n\nCut to E in the chair.\n\nE: I think you have to open your mind a little bit, to try to understand the mentality of… the kind of man who would actually set up a bear-trap, not only in an urban environment that is itself located in a land with a bear populace of nil; but actually indoors, in a workplace- and then leave it there, set up, for any unsuspecting runner to step into. … I think once you understand the kind of levels of… malice…  involved in such an act… it is a strain not to get a bit angry, yeah.\n\nCut to shot of T standing over G in hospital bed eyes closed, R holds cam.\n\nT: … I don’t think we need to worry. There’s no way he’s coming back from this.\n\nG: (Opens eyes) … It’s you. (Looks at space above cam (R)) And you.\n\nT: Shh, shh, now. Go back to sleep.\n\nCut to G in the chair.\n\nG: When I first started to get lucid again, I was in a great deal of pain. I couldn’t eat, or shit, or breathe properly, and my mind was fixed on one thing: I was going to kill that fucking priest, and then I was going to kill all those fucking kids dossing about in my studios. I had two tours in Afghanistan under my belt, so I knew that with the right preparation none of them should have posed any real threat to me.\n\nCut to shot of drugs laid out on table, F stands over, R holds cam.\n\nR (OS): Right people. Henry’s in lock-up right now, and I can’t be bothered with findin’ out what’s going on with the others; thought I’d just take you through my purchases from my man here today-\n\nRaises cam to show F, F smiles, through the window behind him we see G standing on car in car-park, with an M16, and a loud-speaker.\n\nR (OS): Shit, what the fuck’s he doing?\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: The way I remember it, Jenine and I were going over some changes to the script. I wasn’t happy with them; I wasn’t happy with Jenine; I was in a bad mood. Suddenly there’s this fuck-off explosion-\n\nCut to shot of very dusty room, rumbling sounds, R holds cam, F is bloodied and unconscious on floor.\n\nR (OS): Frank! Frank! For the love of God Frank, please wake up!\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: If I had to choose… between not having lived through all the terrible shit that happened that day, and not having ever tried to make the film… I’d say fuck the film. No one deserves that shit.\n\nCut to shot of very dusty corridor, R holds cam and has F over his shoulders, T; S; B; J come running from the other end, T screaming into radio-mic.\n\nT: Pinky! Pinky, we need you, over!\n\nCut to P in the chair, holding a broken radio-mic.\n\nP: … I don’t know what happened to it. Could’ve been a number of things.\n\nCut to G in the chair.\n\nG: At that stage I wasn’t even trying to hurt any of them. All I wanted was a way to get to the Bishop. I’ll admit, though, I was enjoying myself. A bit.\n\nCut to shot of crew huddled in dusty corridor, R moves cam up to window to show G on car with aforementioned items.\n\nG: (Through loud-speaker) Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! Let justice be done upon him!\n\nR (OS): I think he wants you out there, Tim.\n\nT (OS): I ain’t going out there.\n\nG: (Through loud-speaker) If you do not bring out your priest in T-minus ten minutes, then I will continue to blow apart your barricades, and you will be entirely without defence.\n\nR (OS): Fuckin’ ‘ell. (Moving cam down to crew.) He wants the Bishop.\n\nT: - Make the call, Jenine.\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: … I woke up in Lewisham with, literally, no memory of how I’d gotten there-\n\nCut to H in the chair.\n\nH: I have a different phone for the calls I get regarding demon-slaying, and it’s never off. Once I know that a call from a certain number has only yielded a hoax in the past, though, I will block-list that number, so, no, there’s no way she could have gotten through.\n\nCut to R holding cam on G through window, G looking at watch.\n\nG: (Through loud-speaker) Nine minutes!\n\nJ (OS): Ah, he’s block-listed me, bastard!\n\nR moves cam down to huddled crew as she speaks.\n\nB: Give me his number, I’ll call him from my phone.\n\nCut to H in the chair.\n\nH: I did get a call that day though… not about a demon, but about a human threat. A human who wanted me, for something he claims I did to him. What interested me was not this war-torn straggler, but the one who called me about him, to ask for my help.\n\nCut to shot of B on phone in dusty corridor, R holds cam.\n\nB: … You remember me? … Yeah, yeah I’m the one who put a stop to your craziness the last time, now I need you to put a stop to someone else’s. You know where to find us.\n\nB hangs up and walks back to T; S; F; J, cam swings round with him.\n\nB: He’s coming down.\n\nG (OS): (Through loud-speaker) Eight minutes!\n\nT: … You know there could be a way to work this to our advantage.\n\nS: - No.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: See at the time I was under the impression that Pierre was avoiding us because he was afraid the Bishop might come back. And, well… we need Pierre. He gets a bit crazy sometimes, and he doesn’t do too well around females, but he’s still twice as competent and twice as loyal as that fucking crackhead. I thought if there was a way to ensure that the site-owner and the Bishop would… cancel each other out, then that could’ve been and end to at least, I’d say… twenty percent of our problems.\n\nCut back to dusty corridor and crew.\n\nS: I’ve had it with your hare-brained schemes!\n\nG (OS): (Through loud-speaker) Seven minutes!\n\nB: No, no, he’s right. We can kill two birds with one stone here.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: Or two maniacs, with one bomb.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: I was just starting to get a bit depressed I think, by all the death and the bloodshed we’d had, so early on in the making… Not that a lot of it was really our fault, but just that… I just wanted to see an end to it, is all. It was getting me down.\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: (Shrugs) I think it was a great idea.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: Problem being, as I often find to be the case with Tim’s plans, that we weren’t properly equipped to carry it out. There were no bombs in the building; there were no materials with which to make any bombs-\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: I pride myself on being able to fashion explosives out of almost any house-hold item. Unfortunately, we weren’t in a house, we were in a studio, and the studio was in pretty bad shape.\n\nCut to shot through window of G, H approaches him from behind.\n\nG: (Through loud-speaker) Six minutes!\n\nH draws sword and runs G through; G falls; H picks up MI6 and looks up at cam; then stalks OS. R moves cam around.\n\nR (OS): Where’s he gone?\n\nH (OS): Frente a mí, cobarde!\n\nCam swings round to H standing with flaming sword and M16 a ways down the corridor. B steps onto shot and towards H.\n\nB: … Estoy aquí, vil canalla.\n\nCut to G in the chair.\n\nG: … The first time it happened I was angry, but after the second time I was just a little embarrassed, to be honest. By that point I’d just lost so much blood, that, well… I just gathered it was high time to pack it in, head back to the casino.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: None of us could understand what they were saying. It was clearly some variant of Mexican, but only those two could speak it, so the meaning was lost to us.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: Then Rob goes crazy. He’d told me before about his Peruvian flex, and I suppose I hadn’t listened properly, because… well the Bishop was packing an assault rifle, and Rob was unarmed.\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: … Was there ever any doubt?\n\nCut to F in the chair.\n\nF: I woke up, half the building was blown apart, they had a Bishop locked up in the freezer, this guy was bleeding to death out in the car park… I remember thinking: why does the good shit always happen when I’m having a kip?\n\nCut to -Day 11- R holds cam approaching T &amp; J sitting on the floor of larger room.\n\nJ:  Well you can’t just leave him in there.\n\nT: (To R) What is it, man?\n\nR (OS): Runners are back. Henry’s got a new leg.\n\nT: Fantastic. Get them to clear this place up, will you?\n\nJ: Tim-\n\nT: And call Pierre, and find out what’s up with his fucking radio-mic. We need all hands on deck, yeah?\n\nCut to P in the chair.\n\nP: I am still bitter, about that. At the time I tried not to let how pissed off I was effect my professionalism, but now it’s over I’ve got no problem saying it. I shouldn’t be on fucking cleaning duty. It’s a waste of my talents.\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: … I couldn’t remember… my own name; where I lived; who I was…\n\nCut to J in the chair.\n\nJ: I’ve been Tim’s PA, and Sam’s too, in a way, for about three years now, and I’ve suffered a lot of injustice, and I’ve done what I was told to do, even if I knew it was wrong. But I couldn’t let that man freeze to death. I let him out of the freezer, that night, and… I don’t think he means any more hurt to us.\n\nCut to H in the chair; angry.\n\nH: … They say the ninth circle of hell is cold…\n\nCut to shot of E &amp; Raz in overalls amongst rubble with a wheelbarrow, P &amp; F stand aside with spliff and beers; R holds cam; T &amp; J walk into shot.\n\nT: Well how do I know if things are getting done properly, if you’re running around willy-nilly, disobeying direct orders?\n\nJ: I just did what I thought was right.\n\nJk (OS): Where am I?\n\nCam swings round to show Jk in the street, in a daze, stay on him, dazed. Cut to S in the chair.\n\nS: Then the producer showed up outside, with no memories prior to having left the site… which couldn’t have been my doing, I never told him to forget anything except what the crackhead looked like.\n\nCut back to Jk in street, he looks up at space above cam.\n\nJk: … You’re that fucking crackhead.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: Which… is the only thing he did seem to remember.\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: I look up, and I see this crackhead, right, and I don’t know how I know him, but I know I’ve seen him somewhere before.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: … And I think it was then that we first started to realise that Jenine’s menstrual cycle had begun to effect us in more ways than we were even aware of.\n\nCut to P in the chair.\n\nP: I’m not misogynistic, yeah, I just don’t trust women.\n\nCut to shot of P &amp; F aside with spliff and beers; R holds cam; J approaches.\n\nJ: Listen, Pierre, the runners have got to look after the producer so, could you finish the clearing up out here?\n\nP: … No.\n\nCam swings round to door as B falls through it, drenched in blood and gasping for air. Cut to B in the chair.\n\nB: I certainly didn’t want to see Jack remember everything that had happened… but that doesn’t mean I wanted to see him abused and humiliated by the runners, either. I was still technically on his payroll.\n\nCut to make-up room, Jk sits in chair with a lot of make-up on, Raz &amp; E stand over him, R holds cam.\n\nR (OS): It’s a bit much on the eyes, but… fuck it let’s get him into a decent dress, at least.\n\nCut to E in the chair.\n\nE: Tim goes off to order some Chinese and leaves me and Raz in charge of the producer. We racked our brains for ways to… try to stop him from remembering…\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: I thought dressing him up was to a good way to prevent him from realising who he was, I mean, it’d confuse anyone. I mean, you’d be thinking, who am I, you’d look in the mirror, and you’d be like, oh; I’m a tranny.\n\nCut to R in the chair, nodding.\n\nR: It was a solid plan.\n\nCut to shot of Jk standing in make-up room in make-up and dress, Raz &amp; E stand behind, R holds cam.\n\nR (OS): Give us a twirl then.\n\nCam swings round to door as S falls through it, drenched in blood and gasping for air. Cut to S in the chair.\n\nS: I don’t know where it kept coming from. It can’t have been anything to do with Jenine, I don’t know where they all got that idea.\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: Second time I saw it I knew things were getting too weird, and I’d need to get my fix earlier than usual. I go outside and ask this guy if he knows any dealers in the area-\n\nCut to F in the chair.\n\nF: This geezer comes up to me asking if I know any dealers, I was like- know a dealer? - I am a dealer.\n\nCut to T searching through bags of Chinese food in office, R enters holding cam.\n\nR (OS): We’ve got Jack in the dress-room. He’s looking pretty good.\n\nT: … Where’s the fucking special fried rice?\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: I do specifically remember ordering the special fried rice.\n\nCut to Lee in the chair.\n\nL: (Laughing) He’s always asking for special fried rice, we always give him plain boiled. We get a real kick out of that.\n\nCut to shot of Jk outside in dress and make-up jogging on the spot, Raz; E; F; P stand aside; R holds cam.\n\nR (OS): Keep those knees high, remember-\n\nCam swings round to door as T falls through it, drenched in blood and gasping for air. Cut to J in the chair.\n\nJ: It seemed to be happening to a lot of them, and they all for some reason seemed to think it had something to do with menstruation, so immediately turned to me as the culprit.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: Where else was it coming from?\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: I don’t think it was Jenine’s fault, per se, but… it can’t have been the runner’s ghost; Raz was alive and well, and… well it was just everywhere, and we had to explain it somehow.\n\nCut to shot of J tied up in larger room, T; B; S; P; E; Raz stand round her; R holds cam.\n\nP: She’s a witch!\n\nR (OS): You’re going down Jenine!\n\nP: She’s a witch!\n\nR (OS): - You’re going the fuck down!\n\nT: Wait! … Where’s the producer?\n\nCam swings round to door as Jk falls through it, in dress and make-up, drenched in blood and gasping for air. Cut to J in the chair.\n\nJ: They decided not to burn me, in the end. Which I suppose was thoughtful of them.\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: When the blood hit me it was like… suddenly I remembered who I was, and everything, but, I couldn’t remember how I’d gotten there, or why I was dressed up like that. It was a bit of a shock.\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: It happened to each of us, at least once, and it was never nice. We called it kissing the rainbow. For that guy we had dressed up, though, I think it was more than just a sticky inconvenience for him, it was… well he was a new man.\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: I just wanted to say yes to everything, y’know? - Everything. These guys were making a movie, I remember thinking: great; good for you; keep it up.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: So that one wasn’t going to be a problem any more, but there were three more producers who were all scheduled for days on the set, and if they discovered what we’d done to the first one; or any of the other things we’d done… I just want to make it known that I did see it coming. And I did take preventative measures, only… well the measures were rash, and manic, and didn’t really prevent anything.\n\nCut to shot of T in overalls with wheelbarrow outside, night-time, R approaches with cam.\n\nR (OS): Alright Tim, what you doing?\n\nT: … I’m building a wall, Ryan. I’m building a wall.\n\nCut to -Day 12- S in the chair.\n\nS: The next day I couldn’t even get in to do my scene, some idiot had built a fuck-off wall right in front of the door to the studio.\n\nCut to shot of S; B; J; E; Raz standing in front of wall, Raz is tapping it with his fingers and sniffing it; R holds cam.\n\nE: … It definitely wasn’t there yesterday, was it?\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: The business with the wall… well it prevented us from getting in, so it did more-or-less put a stop to the entire making of the film. It really… it really did get in the way of things.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: When I’d finished the wall I looked around and realised that I’d finished it from the wrong side, and I had in fact bricked myself into the studio. Which wouldn’t’ve been so bad only we’d had iron bars installed across all the windows the previous week, because the crackhead kept breaking in during the night and stealing the props; then we’d just have to go and buy them back from the pawn shop, and… well that was costing us money.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: They’re good bars, them. I’ve tried everything.\n\nCut to shot of J; S; B leaning against wall; R holds cam.\n\nJ: You don’t think he’s in there, do you?\n\nS: I’d say it’s more than likely.\n\nJ: … Shouldn’t we… try to get him out?\n\nS: … Give him a few days. We could all use a break. (Phone rings, takes out of pocket) It’s him. (Answers) Yeah? No I’m in Covent Garden. Um, acting class. Well that’s nice of you to say, but I thought I’d check it out anyway. No, I’ll be in tomorrow, yeah. You’ve done what? Well that was stupid, wasn’t it? I dunno, call Jenine. Get the fire brigade or something. Yeah, alright, good luck with it (hangs up).\n\nMoment of silence; J’s phone rings.\n\nS: - Don’t answer it.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: Jenine wasn’t answering her phone, then my phone died, and we didn’t have a land-line on set, and I remember feeling a bit like the walls were closing in on me. But I thought, no Tim; you’re alright, - at least you’ve got your medicine.\n\nCut to S walking down street away from site, R holds cam, S tasting white powder from bag.\n\nS: (To R) What is this stuff?\n\nR (OS): Dunno, I nabbed it out of Tim’s desk last night. Strong, though.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: - But no. Fucking crackheads. It felt like light-years I was in there… I’d been digging a tunnel; I’d fairly seriously considered eating my own legs; and I’d had enough conversations with myself by that point that the discussions just didn’t seem to yield anything, any more. After I’d broken down and given up a fair few times I was brought back to a fairly carnal state, trying furiously to remember what it was that first separated us from the animals.\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: Sam goes off with the crackhead so, Jenine and I- being decent people- call the necessary people and get the wall down a couple of hours later. We found Tim in the very back of the building, naked, hunched over some flints and kindling he’d stripped from one of the chairs, just… raving… I mean, really raving.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: It can’t have only been two hours. I still don’t believe that.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: We all just took the day off, innit, I thought the earliest that wall was coming down would at least be later on in the afternoon, and I’d just scored some really banging shit out of Tim’s desk. Just as well we didn’t come back that day though, as I heard that, when they first got Tim out he’d… lost something, in there.\n\nCut to E in the chair.\n\nE: Apparently he was buck naked, yeah, trying to start a fire, with some rocks, and a chair. Then when they got him outside he started shouting his head off about a sacrifice to the Sun God. Hey, that’s just what I heard.\n\nCut to T in the chair, petting a lamb.\n\nT: No it did come up anyway. Don’t know why I thought it wouldn’t.\n\nCut to -Day 13- R holds cam to face walking down corridor.\n\nR: You want the real truth, people? You want the real fucking truth? You can’t even handle the real fucking truth. You can’t even handle it. (Opens door, looks inside empty room) Oh it’s not this one. (Continues walking) Here we go.\n\nEnters the next room where T; S; J are leaping out of a bed in a state of undress.\n\nS: Get him out!\n\nR (OS): The truth people! The fucking truth! (Waving cam around as T; S; J attempt to hide).\n\nS: Get him out!\n\nR moves cam on S who pushes him away, cracking sound is heard, cam falls and is picked up by S to show R on floor unconscious, T standing over with baseball bat.\n\nT: Fucking… crackheads, like. How does he still keep getting in? Has he got keys to the building or something?\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: The camera does not lie.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: We’ve only got one bed on site, so if we’ve worked a bit too late sometimes we will share it, yeah. Nothing happens.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: It’s quite clever footage that the crackhead got there, actually; he makes it look a lot like something was going on, but it really can’t have been. I can’t remember exactly what happened that night, but Sam and I have an agreement about that sort of thing, and I’m pretty sure Jenine’s a lesbian.\n\nCut to J in the chair.\n\nJ: Not exclusively, no, but yeah, I did tell Tim that. I don’t usually lie about stuff like that but, at the time it… seemed like there was just no other way.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: I tried it on with her a few times, yeah. Back in the day. I didn’t hire her to do the fucking filing, did I?\n\nRe-show shot of T falling through door drenched in blood and gasping for air, this time in slow-motion. Cut to shot of E &amp; Raz sitting on broken wall outside, R approaches holding cam.\n\nR (OS): Morning boys. (Hands E some money) Couldn’t run down to Frank quickly could you mate, I’ve just had bit of a knock on the back of the head-\n\nCam jerks and rattles as R is pushed forward, swings round to show S still in a state of undress, angry.\n\nS: What have I told you? You can’t go in there, yeah?\n\nR (OS): Alright, I won’t.\n\nS: Seriously, Ryan.\n\nR (OS): Alright, I won’t.\n\nS: (Walking back inside) … Keep it out of the fucking bedroom.\n\nR (OS): Alright, I will.\n\nMoves cam back to E &amp; Raz; both grinning.\n\nRaz: You catch ‘em at it then?\n\nR (OS): Close enough to it, yeah.\n\nJacob (OS): Is this the film set?\n\nCam swings round to Jb in the street.\n\nR (OS): Maybe it is. Who’re you?\n\nJb: I’m Jacob, I’m Jenine’s boyfriend.\n\nR (OS): Is it. Is it. Alright mate I’ll just go get her then.\n\nJb: … Alright.\n\nBlurred movements as R goes inside and up to previous room in which T; S; J are getting dressed, they look up at R.\n\nS: What did I just tell you?\n\nT: Seriously mate, I was going easy the last time (raising baseball bat).\n\nR (OS): Jenine, your boyfriend’s outside.\n\nT: - Boyfriend?\n\nZoom in on J looking uncomfortable. Cut to S in the chair.\n\nS: Surprised all of us. I was dead sure she was a dike.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: For me, that moment changed everything. I’d gotten some good shit recorded before that, but when Jenine’s boyfriend shows up, then I knew I’d gotten my hands on some seriously sensitive material. The kind of shit these executive types might pay good money to keep under wraps, you could say.\n\nCut to Jb in the chair.\n\nJb: I’d just gotten back from a stint in Haiti, a mate of mine had lost his house and that in the quake and I was just helping him out, you know. Anyway I thought I’d go see her as soon as I arrived, even though she’s always trying to keep me away from her work. I find her just… in hysterics, you know; tearful, going on about some crackhead trying to blackmail her. I said alright Jenine, calm down, yeah, help take me through this- what’s he got on you?\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: He is a crafty fucker, that one. I’ll give him that. He knew that if he’d raised the subject with either me or Sam, we would’ve just smashed the tape, and that would’ve been the end of the diary. So he goes after Jenine, and… well Jenine’s always been a bit…\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: We should’ve seen it coming really. I think all the extortion that went on behind the scenes was… the main reason that crackhead took to filming the video-diary in the first place.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: I had her by the fuckin’ ovaries; I was rakin’ it in-\n\nCut to J in the chair, head in hands. Raises head.\n\nJ: Of course I was happy to see him. I did tell him not to visit me at work, though. I told him that. …  I couldn’t let him see what was on the tape. It would’ve been… just… too difficult to explain.\n\nCut to Jb in the chair.\n\nJb: So she tells me he’s got photographic evidence, yeah, of her, and two other blokes- killing a dog. I said Jenine, why were you killing a dog?\n\nCut to J in the chair.\n\nJ: I told him we needed a dead dog for the film, and they aren’t the easiest things to get hold of, or to make. I told him it was a stray dog, that no one loved, but we could still all get prison sentences if the evidence reached the right people. … It was just the first thing that came into my head.\n\nCut to Jb in the chair.\n\nJb: So at least then I understood why she was always trying to keep me away from her work. They were all very dedicated people, and sometimes they crossed lines others wouldn’t. I could respect that. It just didn’t explain how the evidence found its way into the hands of this fucking crackhead; or why those other two blokes weren’t emptying their fucking pockets for him.\n\nCut to shot of ATM screen asking for pin number, R holds cam; turns it round onto Jb.\n\nR (OS): What’s the number?\n\nCut to Jb in the chair.\n\nJb: I wasn’t about to let this crackhead get one over on me, but I couldn’t have him going to the RSPCA either-\n\nCut to shot of B; E; Raz in office each holding a bag of cash; R holds cam.\n\nB: You get all this off Jenine’s boyfriend?\n\nR (OS): Yeah the man’s a fucking gold mine.\n\nCut to Jb in the chair.\n\nJb: I gave him the first instalment without raising any argument; I didn’t want to let him know I had a game plan. Ten minutes later he’s back, and he wants twice as much-\n\nCut to shot of Jb &amp; J sitting on edge of bed in the room with the bed, heads bowed, holding hands; R is entering with cam; Jb looks up.\n\nR (OS): Alright love-birds.\n\nJb: … What is it?\n\nR (OS): I’m just doin’ a video-diary, innit. Anything you’d like to contribute?\n\nJb: … No.\n\nR (OS): Alright, well… I hate to bring this up, but… I might be needing to reload sooner than expected.\n\nJ looks up, angrily. Cut to B in the chair.\n\nB: Apparently he thought it was an act of canicide that Jenine had committed, that the crackhead was holding over them. I can’t imagine why he was willing to pay so much; you only get a small fine, usually; for strays anyway.\n\nCut to Jb in the chair.\n\nJb: I’ve got a couple of mates, and they’re not violent men, but… I couldn’t go to the police, for obvious reasons, and these guys, they specialise in intimidation. Their work is pretty much designed to help people out of situations like the one I found myself in. They’re not cheap, but to be fair it is quite a specialist field.\n\nCut to shot of ATM screen asking for pin number, R holds cam; turns it round onto Jb; we see two guys dressed as Police Men approach from behind Jb.\n\nR (OS): What’s the number again? (Sees the PM, quietly says:) What the fuck is…\n\nPM1: Alright fellas, what’s this then? Bit of blackmail, is it?\n\nR (OS): No.\n\nJb: Heavens no.\n\nPM2: Making a movie are you?\n\nR (OS): … Yeah.\n\nPM1: Alright come on then mate, you’d better come with us.\n\nR (OS): No.\n\nPM2: Just come on down to the station, son, answer a few questions. Come on, it won’t hurt.\n\nR (OS): I don’t want to.\n\nJb: Come on mate, don’t make this difficult.\n\nR (OS): I just don’t want to, alright? No. No. Oi, what you doin’, get off me!\n\nR protests as the PM grab his arms and carry him.\n\nPM1 (OS): Come on, now.\n\nShow gliding shot of pavement as R is carried towards a standard car, continuously protesting.\n\nR (OS): Oi why haven’t you got a real police car? What the fuck is this?!\n\nPM2 (OS): Just get in the fucking car mate.\n\nBlurred shot as R is thrown into car; show the PM get into the front; show the doors lock.\n\nR (OS): What the fuck is going on?\n\nShow Jb through window, waving and smiling as car drives away. Cut to R in the chair.\n\nR: Fuckin’… three days I was gone, none of them lot even batted a fuckin’ eyelid. I remember getting back, and them all just acting like nothing had happened… I found that quite hurtful.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: I noticed he was gone, yeah; he took the fucking camera with him. Just trying to remember now if anything important happened during the days we were without it… I don’t think there was anything, but it’s very hard now to separate the days…\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: A load of stuff happened on those days, yeah. We suffered another Bishop attack; the former producer showed up having lost his house and moved into the loft-space; one of the runners was blind for a bit; we found out where all the blood was coming from; we declared war on a local Chinese restaurant-\n\nCut to H in the chair, sighing and shaking his head, raises bag of blood and begins to drink. Cut to E in the chair.\n\nE: Me and Raz spent a whole afternoon preparing Molotov cocktails out of some bed sheets and cans of diesel, for an assault on Lee’s place across the road; something about plain boiled rice, I think-\n\nCut to L in the chair, have him say some angry stuff in Chinese, and blow on his fingertips to indicate fire. Cut to Jb in the chair.\n\nJb: Nah, problem was solved. I just took my money- and Jenine- back home. I did go and visit the crackhead again, but… I won’t talk about that.\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: I couldn’t tell you much, I lost my eyesight later that day and it wasn’t fully back for another couple of nights. My question, right- why call it a cocktail, if you’re not meant to drink it?\n\nCut to P in the chair.\n\nP: No. Didn’t see any of them, those days.\n\nCut to F in the chair.\n\nF: My income, just… plummeted-\n\nCut to J in the chair.\n\nJ: I needed a few days off, after all the calamity, but to be honest it’s more like work when I’m away; Sam just does not stop calling me, ever.\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: I lost my house, my wife, and all three of my children in one bad round of rock paper scissors-\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: Those were the worst days. I don’t do well when Jenine isn’t around, she’s not even my PA but I’ve become dependent, really. There was no one to help me tie my shoelaces; no one was bringing me my meals; I had to go to the toilet by myself-\n\nCut to G in the chair, he shrugs and looks bemused. Cut to R in the chair.\n\nR: The only footage that exists from those days wasn’t taken on set, and it wasn’t taken by me. I’ve wondered about putting this in, it’s not a strong moment for me but… no, I’m glad I did. It’s important you people see just how fucked up coppers can be in this city.\n\nCut to shot of R tied to chair and blindfolded in dark room, one of the PM is waving the cam over him. The PM are moving around the room and making strange sounds from different areas, causing R to turn his head apprehensively in the direction of the sounds. Jb walks onto shot and cam stays still on R as Jb unzips his trousers.\n\nJb: Alright you blackmailing bastard… prepare to be pissed on.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: The rest is… far too graphic. I had no problem leaving it in, but the FCC said the whole thing’d have to be X-rated if we didn’t take it out.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: … And if you can’t get your message through to the children, then what’s the fucking point?\n\nCut to -Day 16- Raz holds cam to face, sitting in office.\n\nRaz: Alright everyone. Ryan brought the camera back today but he’s off having a sulk about something, and Henry goes swimming on Tuesdays, and no one else seems to care; so I thought I’d keep the diary going, y’know, in the absence of anyone official. Um… it’s about noon, on the… well I don’t know the date, but I’m just milling about in here on my jays really, neither Tim or Sam have showed up yet and it’s only Jenine downstairs, and she’s… well I don’t know what she’s doing-\n\nSound of door opening, cam swings round to show T entering with papers.\n\nT: Fuck’re you doing in my office? You’re not going to stab me again are you?\n\nRaz (OS): I might.\n\nS enters behind T, out of breath.\n\nS: Were you listening to me?\n\nT: … Yes.\n\nS: I didn’t get a wink of sleep.\n\nT: … I’ll deal with it.\n\nS: When?\n\nRaz (OS): …What’s this about then?\n\nS &amp; T look up at cam; cut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: They said I could live in the loft-space. They didn’t say anything about ‘rules’, or ‘time zones’. I’m my own man, yeah. The drum-kit was the only belonging I had to my name and yes, I played it as often as I could.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: The producer- well, former, producer- he just wouldn’t stop playing the drums, even when I was trying to talk to him he’d just be banging away; I wasn’t getting any sleep… I asked Tim to deal with it and I think he called up that guy Pierre to kidnap him or something, but Pierre was just useless-\n\nCut to doorway; Raz holds cam; enter P.\n\nP: Alright Raz. Where is everyone?\n\nRaz (OS): Dunno mate it’s a bit all over the place today. Couldn’t tell you, really.\n\nP: Alright. D’you know what he needs me for?\n\nRaz (OS): Something about… drums? Maybe?\n\nDrum-beat can be heard from another room, P’s head darts around in fear.\n\nRaz (OS): Pierre, what’s up?\n\nP: … Jumanji…\n\nP runs OS and Raz chases after him so we get a shot of P running down the stairs and out the front door in a wild frenzy.\n\nRaz (OS): Pierre! … Where you goin’?\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: … I have absolutely no memory of that day. It’s just gone.\n\nCut to P in the chair.\n\nP: Sometimes different kinds of rhythms… can affect me very deeply… I had a bad experience with a board game once…\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: Oi, d’you know what, yeah? I should’ve just clapped him the first time he asked me to keep the noise down- what right has he got, trying to stop a man from doing what he loves?\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: He never once gave any indication that he could hear me-\n\nCut to shot moving down corridor; Raz holds cam; drums can be heard OS.\n\nRaz (OS): Feel the beat. Feel the beat.\n\nEntering room in which Jk is playing the drums; S is standing; B is dancing.\n\nS: Can you just stop it, please?\n\nHones in on B caught in a dance loop with pained expression; cut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: I found Rob stuck, in a kind of rain-dance loop, and it seemed, anyway, as if, as long as Jack was playing those drums; he had next to no control over his own body-\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: My motor-functions are very susceptible to sound waves. Not so much what I hear, but if it’s loud enough that I can feel it, then… there’s not really anything I can do. I did try to force myself out of it once, and I was successful, but… about three seconds later I had a stroke, and I’m pretty sure the two things are related. These days I just… let it take me.\n\nCut back to shot of B caught in the dance loop, Raz can be heard laughing OS and S can be heard shouting at Jk; the beat continues. Cut to shot entering office where T &amp; J sit with coffee; Raz holds cam.\n\nT: … Why do you keep coming into my office?\n\nRaz (OS): Just thought I’d let you know it’s only a matter of time before Sam kills Jack, and Rob’s stuck in a rain-dance.\n\nT: … That all?\n\nRaz (OS): Well the situation won’t solve itself, Tim; and Pierre’s run off.\n\nT: Look, Raz- is it? I take no pleasure in saying this, but get the fuck out of my office. Runners stay downstairs, yeah?\n\nCam swings round as E enters with towel over his shoulders.\n\nRaz (OS): Alright Henry.\n\nE: Alright Raz.\n\nRaz (OS): Good swim?\n\nE: Yeah it was alright, yeah. What’s that noise?\n\nRaz (OS): There’s a drum-kit upstairs.\n\nE: Oh, nice-\n\nT (OS): Why… do I always… seem to find myself… here, with you?\n\nCam swings round as T is talking to show that he is addressing the samurai sword he has pulled out from under the desk.\n\nT: (Standing and raising sword at Raz &amp; E) Get out of here, now. Go on. I’ve used it before; I’ll use it again. (Climbing over desk.)\n\nMoving shot as Raz &amp; E leave room and door slams behind them, then Raz has cam on E out in the corridor.\n\nRaz (OS): What d’you think of the beat Henry?\n\nE: I like it, yeah. Let’s go check it out.\n\nShow E’s back and corridor and that entering room with the drum-kit; B stuck in the loop; S is trying to grab the drumsticks but Jk is swivelling on the chair and avoiding him, continuing the beat. Move between this and E observing, then move to door as R enters.\n\nR: - Who’s playing the fucking drums? Who’s-\n\nR kicks over base-drum; beat stops; Jk leaps up in righteous indignation.\n\nJk: - Oi what you doin’?\n\nS: Thank you Ryan.\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: I wasn’t having that. There’s no way I was having that.\n\nCut to R in the chair.\n\nR: I’d been kept in a fuckin’ dungeon or suttin’ for three days; pissed on; I was hungry; I wasn’t high; I couldn’t sleep; and here’s this dickface- of all the instruments he could be playing, yeah, I mean; a harp, that could be nice, yeah-\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: We were all standing there, and the more I thought about what he’d done, the angrier I got-\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: It was getting very tense between the two of them, I didn’t give a shit, y’know, I was off; mission accomplished. Only, as I was leaving, two things happened at once-\n\nCut to B in the chair.\n\nB: What I didn’t know at that point was that if the beat is suddenly cut off mid-flow, then, it has much the same effect as when I try to force myself out of it-\n\nCut to B in the drum-room, spasmodic on the floor; Raz still holding cam.\n\nE (OS): The fuck’s wrong with him?\n\nCam swings round to E as he speaks, showing that P has entered with a large sack behind him and Jk and R are still staring each other down; S stands by the door; P throws sack over Jk and quickly drags the bundle outside. Cut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: Apparently he was just waiting outside ‘til the drums stopped-\n\nCut to E in the chair.\n\nE: Yeah, Rob had a stroke, then the producer was kidnapped, in almost the same second-\n\nCut to P in the chair.\n\nP: As I was running outside I remembered what Tim had called me about, so I grabbed the sack out of the car-\n\nCut to Jk in the chair.\n\nJk: I was staring into his eyes, fuming, right, everything was going red; then everything goes black-\n\nCut to -Day 17- R holds cam entering office where T &amp; J sit; T on the phone.\n\nT: No. No. Well, do what you want with him, mate, alright. That’s your business. I wouldn’t know anything about his family, would I? Alright. (Hangs up.)\n\nR (OS): Alright Tim. What’s that about?\n\nT: … Pierre seems to think we’re actually going to pay a ransom to get the producer back. … Fucking… idiot.\n\nR (OS): Yeah. You’re right not to negotiate with these people. You know if you paid up he’d only do the same thing again next week.\n\nT: - What’re you doing up here man?\n\nR (OS): I’m here for Jenine actually. Jenine, Raz wants you outside.\n\nT: What, the runner? What’s he want her for? She’s busy.\n\nJ: (Standing) I’d better go see him, Tim.\n\nCut to T in the chair.\n\nT: The runner who stabbed me… had this strange kind of hold, over Jenine. I can’t explain it. She started spending more and more time with him, and as a result, the organisation process she’d always brought to the table… vanished.\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: I’ve been called a sexist. I’ve been called a lot of horrible things. Thief. Home-wrecker. Child-abuser. But it’s not sexism, what I do; because it’s not all women. Just once, every once in a while I’ll look into a woman’s eyes and know- I just know; that she’s gonna be my bitch.\n\nCut to S in the chair.\n\nS: I woke up raging that day, so I went to go see Jenine. Overnight the prices had just rocketed; I said Raz, you’ll be running me out of house and home with these prices, what’ve you done; sprayed a bit of perfume on her or something? I mean you can’t just raise the price of a commodity without improving the commodity itself; there’s got to be a law-\n\nCut to shot of doorway; S &amp; J walk through; S looks pissed off; R holds cam; S walks off in one direction and J another; cam follows J to where Raz is leaning against the wall wearing pimp attire and smoking a spliff. J hands him some money, and Raz rubs her face. Cut to J in the chair.\n\nJ: Raz really cares about me, you know? That’s what no one else can understand. He does care.\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: I was lucky, with Jenine. On set it was like, having a monopoly, y’know, we made a lot of money. Only problem was the same old problem; fucking boyfriends. Who are these men, who think they own women?\n\nCut to Jb in the chair.\n\nJb: Jenine always spent a lot of time at the film set, but it got to the point where she was just never home, any more. I drive up there to go see what’s keeping her, and on the way there-\n\nCut to shot of J in street night-time, whored-up; R holds cam, car drives up and stops, window rolls down; Jb driving; J does not turn around.\n\nR (OS): Oi Jenine I think you’ve caught one over here.\n\nJb: … Jenine?\n\nCut to Jb in the chair.\n\nJb: I don’t know what she was thinking. I said Jenine, you’ll catch your death out here love, come on now; I get her in the car and I take her back home. Ten minutes later this bloke from the film set knocks on the door; saying he wants his bitch back. I said you must’ve come to the wrong house mate, there’s no bitches here.\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: I’ve found you have to crack down on that kind of mentality as soon as you can, and as hard as you can, and then keep cracking down on it; continuously, until whatever it is in the bitch’s mind that makes her think that craziness just… isn’t going to be an issue, any more.\n\nCut to shot of Raz walking on set holding J by the arm; R holds cam; Raz throws J into a room and slams the door, then leans against the wall. E approaches and whispers something to Raz.\n\nRaz: What you asking me for? Ask her; I don’t fuckin’ know.\n\nE nods and goes through the door. Cut to E in the chair.\n\nE: … I’ll admit I heard there was some action going on and I wanted a piece. But I get in there, and I see her, and I think… You’re a young girl… you should be at home. You should be dressed up, going out with boys, going to school, you know; that kind of stuff… Sometimes I think someone should just take this city and just… just flush it down the fucking toilet.\n\nCut to Raz in the chair.\n\nRaz: … Henry started coming to see Jenine more and more and… I knew Henry wasn’t a cop. But the more he started showing up looking decidedly like a man who ain’t getting what he’s paying for, I found myself thinking… maybe he is a fucking cop.\n\nCut to E in the chair, with a mohican.\n\nE: … Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads… Here is a man who would not take it any more. A man who stood up against the scum; the cunts; the dogs; the filth; the shit. Here is a man who stood up.\n\n",
